                   <title>New Self-Service SSO Templates for Okta &amp;amp; Auth0 SAML Now Available!</title>
                   <pubDate>Thu, 19 Feb 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate>
                   <description>We’ve expanded our Self-Service SSO capabilities with two new, highly-requested IdP templates for Okta SAML and Auth0 SAML. This update streamlines the configuration process for your enterprise customers, enabling faster, more reliable SSO integration.

__Guided, Step-by-Step Configuration__

Previously, setting up connections for providers like Okta SAML required using a generic template. Now, your customers will get a purpose-built, guided experience. Our new templates provide detailed, step-by-step instructions with screenshots specific to each IdP, reducing complexity and eliminating guesswork for your customers&amp;apos; IT teams.

__Key Enhancements:__

- New Templates: A dedicated guide for customers who use Okta or Auth0 as their identity provider, making one of the most common connection types easier than ever.
- Reduced Support Load: By making the process more intuitive for your customers, we help reduce your team&amp;apos;s support burden and speed up your enterprise onboarding flow.

                   <title>Session Metadata is now Generally Available for all Enterprise customers.</title>
                   <pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate>
                   <description>## What&amp;apos;s New

Session Metadata allows you to attach custom key–value data to a user&amp;apos;s session using Actions or the Auth0 Management API. This enables you to persist contextual data throughout the session lifecycle, powering richer integrations, stronger audit trails, and personalized session behavior.

### Key capabilities:

- **Set and retrieve metadata in Actions** using `api.session.setMetadata(key, value)` and `event.session.metadata`
- **Manage metadata via Management API** with `GET` and `PATCH` on `/api/v2/sessions/{id}`
- **Delete individual keys** using `api.session.deleteMetadata(key)` or evict all metadata with `api.session.evictMetadata()`
- **Include session metadata in OIDC Back-Channel Logout tokens** for downstream systems to receive context during logout events

### Example usage in Actions:

    exports.onExecutePostLogin = async (event, api) =&amp;gt; {
      api.session.setMetadata(&amp;quot;deviceName&amp;quot;, event.request.user_agent);
      api.session.setMetadata(&amp;quot;loginRegion&amp;quot;, event.request.geoip?.countryCode);
      api.session.setMetadata(&amp;quot;orgContext&amp;quot;, event.organization?.id);
    };

### Limits:

- Maximum of **25 key-value pairs** per session
- Each key and value must be a **string** with max **255 characters**
- Metadata is stored as a flat JSON object (no nesting)

---

## Use Cases

- **Self-service device management**: Store device names or login locations for user-facing session management UIs
- **Keep Me Signed In**: Persist user preferences to customize session behavior
- **Organization context**: Store organization information for multi-tenant applications
- **Audit and compliance**: Include session context in logout tokens for downstream audit systems

---

## Availability

Session Metadata is now **Generally Available** for all Enterprise tenants.

No API or behavior changes from Early Access.

                   <title>Credential Guard: Breached Phone Credentials Support</title>
                   <pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate>
                   <description>To strengthen defenses across the identity surface, we have added millions of breached phone credentials to our detection capabilities within __Credential Guard__

This enhancement allows organizations using Phone as an Identifier to proactively identify compromised credentials and trigger automated security responses, such as login blocks or password resets. 

This expansion ensures that phone-based authentication is as secure as traditional email-based methods without impacting system performance. 

For more information on __Credential Guard__, check out our [online documentation](https://auth0.com/docs/secure/attack-protection/breached-password-detection#detect-breaches-faster-with-credential-guard).

                   <title>Refresh Token Metadata now available in Early Access</title>
                   <pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate>
                   <description>
We&amp;apos;re excited to announce that **Refresh Token Metadata** is now available in **Early Access** for Enterprise customers.

Refresh Token Metadata allows you to attach custom key-value pairs to refresh tokens, enabling richer context storage and more personalized authentication experiences.

### What&amp;apos;s New

**Store Custom Data on Refresh Tokens**

You can now attach up to 25 custom key-value pairs to each refresh token. This metadata persists throughout the token&amp;apos;s lifecycle and can be accessed or modified via the Management API.

```javascript
// In Post-Login Action
exports.onExecutePostLogin = async (event, api) =&amp;gt; {
  api.refreshToken.setMetadata(&amp;apos;deviceName&amp;apos;, event.request.user_agent);
  api.refreshToken.setMetadata(&amp;apos;loginRegion&amp;apos;, event.request.geoip?.countryCode);
  api.refreshToken.setMetadata(&amp;apos;orgContext&amp;apos;, event.organization?.id);
};
```

**Management API Support**

Access and manage refresh token metadata programmatically:

- `GET /api/v2/refresh-tokens/{id}` - Retrieve token with metadata
- `PATCH /api/v2/refresh-tokens/{id}` - Update token metadata
- `DELETE /api/v2/refresh-tokens/{id}` - Revoke token

                   <title> Enhanced Bot Detection Accuracy with JA4 Signals</title>
                   <pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate>
                   <description>To provide a more robust defense against sophisticated automated threats, Auth0 has integrated JA4 signals into the core of our Bot Detection machine learning engine.

The addition of JA4 signals allows our models to surface and mitigate sophisticated automated threats that traditional signals often miss. 

This enhanced security feature is available now to all Enterprise customers with the Attack Protection add-on. The rollout is currently underway and will be completed in the coming weeks, aligned with individual customer release schedules.

                   <title>Better Mobile UX: Numeric Keyboards Now Default for OTPs </title>
                   <pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate>
                   <description>We’re excited to roll out a highly requested update to the mobile login experience! We know that every tap matters when it comes to user conversion, so we’ve eliminated a common friction point in the authentication journey.

![otp_numeric_pad.png](//images.ctfassets.net/kbkgmx9upatd/695PTlpJ9e7m5fcfOonCZy/79286d8ef2a1db5c63bf38543ab14c30/otp_numeric_pad.png)

Previously, users might have been met with a standard alphabetical keyboard when prompted for a code. Now, for all SMS and Email OTP challenges, mobile devices will automatically surface the numeric keyboard. This change spans 16+ touchpoints—including MFA enrollment, Passwordless login, and password resets—ensuring your authentication flow feels native, intuitive, and fast.

### What do you need to do?
Nothing at all. This optimization is automatically enabled for all customers using the Universal Login experience. Your users are already enjoying a smoother, &amp;quot;fat-finger&amp;quot; proof login today!

### Experience it yourself
Trigger an MFA challenge or Passwordless login from your mobile device to see the new flow in action.

                   <title>New FGA Dashboard Logging UI is being rolled out</title>
                   <pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate>
                   <description>We are excited to announce the **FGA Logging UI**! This introduces a web interface to the existing logging API, giving you the ability to view FGA logs directly in the FGA Dashboard. 

Users can now filter, sort and inspect access logs directly from the FGA Dashboard, significantly reducing the time required for debugging and troubleshooting issues.

The Logging UI provides an easy-to-use visual interface with capabilities to sort and filter log entries.

- **Visual Interface:** Users can now immediately view a list of log entries for operations like Check() and Write() in the main viewing area of the UI. Drilling down into a single log entry will open a side panel for a full detailed view of the log data in JSON format, with a convenient copy-and-paste button to quickly copy and paste log data into another application for viewing or saving.

- **Date/time ranges:** Viewing log data can be daunting due to sheer volume. The UI has a convenient date picker to set the time-bound log retrieval window.

- **Filtering:** We’ve introduced a simple search box for filtering. Its simplicity does not take away from its power as the search accepts Lucene syntax (a subset) for advanced querying of logs. Now, retrieving all write operations is as easy as typing request.operation:&amp;quot;Write&amp;quot; into the search box.

- **Sorting:** The UI supports standard sorting of fields for ascending and descending ordering of data, used in situations, for example, when quickly needing to toggle between seeing “newest first” or “oldest first” log data.

For more details, refer to Auth0 FGA’s [logging](https://docs.fga.dev/fga-logging) documentation.</description>

                   <title>Self-Service Domain Verification for Organization Discovery now in Early Access!</title>
                   <pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate>
                   <description>We’ve integrated Organization Discovery by Domain into the Self-Service SSO workflow, eliminating manual backend configuration and providing a seamless login experience for your enterprise users.

__Zero-Touch Discovery__ 
Previously, verifying a domain only configured the SSO connection. Now, when a ticket is scoped to a single Organization, verified domains are automatically synced to the Organization record. This enables [Organization Domain Discovery](https://auth0.com/docs/manage-users/organizations/login-flows-for-organizations#organization-domain-discovery-optional &amp;quot;Organization Domain Discovery&amp;quot;) instantly, allowing end-users to log in with just their email address.

__Key Enhancements:__

- Verify One, Apply Everywhere: Verified domains are added to both the Connection and the Organization simultaneously.
- Domain Association: If a domain was previously verified for an Organization, customers can now simply associate it with a new connection, skipping repeat DNS TXT steps.
- Deterministic Routing: By gating this to a 1:1 mapping, we ensure users are routed to the correct IdP every time.

Learn more about Self-Service SSO in the [product documentation](https://auth0.com/docs/authenticate/enterprise-connections/self-service-SSO &amp;quot;product documentation&amp;quot;).

By using Self-Service SSO Domain Verification for Organization Discovery by Domain, you agree to the applicable Free Trial terms in Okta’s Master Subscription Agreement and Okta’s Privacy Policy during use of the Early Access feature. The Free Trial terms can be found within the Master Subscription Agreement at [https://www.okta.com/agreements](https://www.okta.com/agreements &amp;quot;https://www.okta.com/agreements&amp;quot;).</description>

                   <title>API Access Policies for Applications is now Generally Available</title>
                   <pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate>
                   <description>We are pleased to announce that __API Access Policies for Applications__ is now Generally Available (GA) for all Auth0 customers. This feature allows you to specifically control which applications can request access tokens for your APIs, covering __both user and machine-to-machine access__.

Previously available only via the Management API, these __policies can now be fully configured directly within the Auth0 Dashboard__. The new UI allows you to easily visualize and manage permissions per API, ensuring that only authorized applications can access sensitive resources.

__Key Benefits__:
- __Granular Control__: Define distinct access policies for user access vs. machine-to-machine access.
- __Enhanced Security__: Use the `require_client_grant` policy to ensure only explicitly authorized applications can obtain tokens for the subset of allowed permissions.
- __Simplified Management__: Configure these settings visually through the new Dashboard UI.

To learn more, navigate to Applications &amp;gt; APIs &amp;gt; Application Access in the dashboard or read our [reference docs](https://auth0.com/docs/get-started/apis/api-access-policies-for-applications).

                   <title>Roles for the Auth0 FGA Dashboard</title>
                   <pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate>
                   <description>We are excited to release the __Per-Member Authorization__ feature that introduces __roles__ to the FGA Dashboard! This allows you to grant appropriate levels of access based on users’ needs.

We are enhancing the permission model from a single admin to __Groups__ that can be assigned roles. Groups are an organizational container for managing permissions and offer convenience when assigning roles to multiple users at once.

- __New Roles__: We are introducing three new granular roles to sit alongside the previous admin role (now renamed __Account Owner__):
  - __Group Manager__: An account-level role for managing teams without accessing FGA stores directly.
  - __Store Editor__: A store-level role that can modify models and tuples but cannot manage groups.
  - __Store Viewer__: A read-only role useful for ops teams or sales engineers who need visibility without the ability to impact systems.
- __Groups__: Account Owners or Group Managers can create groups (ex., &amp;quot;IT Group&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Dev Team&amp;quot;) and assign members to them. All members automatically inherit the permissions defined at the group level.
- __Scoping__: Crucially, these roles can be scoped to specific stores. For example, this allows a single user, to be an Editor for a &amp;quot;Staging&amp;quot; store but restricted to Viewer for a &amp;quot;Production&amp;quot; store.

For more details, refer to Auth0 FGA Dashboard’s [Roles](https://docs.fga.dev/dashboard/roles) documentation.

                   <title>Inbound SCIM Groups for Enterprise Connections is now in Limited Early Access</title>
                   <pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate>
                   <description>We’re pleased to announce that support for Groups within Auth0’s [Inbound SCIM for Enterprise Connections](https://auth0.com/docs/authenticate/protocols/scim/configure-inbound-scim) feature is now in limited early access!

This release is useful for developers that support users and groups natively in their applications, and need to support integrations with Enterprise identity providers that use SCIM 2.0 to remotely manage these users and groups.

__New group capabilities added:__

- __SCIM groups endpoint per connection__ - Each Enterprise connection gets dedicated SCIM */users* and */groups* endpoints and dedicated credentials that enable provisioning, de-provisioning, and management of the users and groups specific to that connection.

- __Sync groups from Auth0 to external systems__  - Users and groups provisioned inbound to Auth0 can be synchronized outbound to external systems using Auth0’s [Event streams](https://auth0.com/docs/customize/events) feature.   

- __Use groups in the Post-Login Action__ - Use group information pushed from Enterprise identity providers in your Auth0 [post-login actions](https://auth0.com/docs/customize/actions/explore-triggers/signup-and-login-triggers/login-trigger) to make access control and authorization decisions in Auth0.  

- __View groups in the Auth0 Dashboard__ - All groups provisioned using SCIM can be viewed in the Auth0 Dashboard under a new Enterprise Groups tab, as well as per user under the Users section. 

__How to get access__

To join the Limited EA program and access SCIM Groups for Enterprise connections, complete the [EA Terms &amp;amp; Conditions form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeGhlEuXSm4hqrP9DZgeEWtntUHCSzqCpKC_yiK2ISIUubsGg/viewform) and contact your Auth0 Account Team to request activation and supporting documentation.</description>

                   <title>Universal Custom Password Hash for Bulk Import - Now in Limited Early Access!</title>
                   <pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate>
                   <description>We’re excited to introduce __Universal Custom Password Hash__ in Limited Early Access (EA), enabling user migrations into Auth0 without disrupting sign-ins - even when your existing system uses custom or legacy password formats.

With __Universal Custom Password Hash__ you can bring existing users over through [Bulk Import](https://auth0.com/docs/manage-users/user-migration/bulk-user-imports) and use [Auth0 Actions](https://auth0.com/docs/customize/actions) to script custom password validation logic for your environment so users can continue signing in with their current credentials.

__Key Capabilities:__
- __Support for custom password formats during migration__: Migrate users from legacy and proprietary systems while maintaining the existing sign-in experience. 
- __Custom validation logic with Auth0 Actions__: Write and deploy password validation logic that matches your current security architecture using Actions.
- __Seamless end-user experience__: Users continue to sign in as usual - less password resets and less support tickets means reduced rollout friction.
- __Built for enterprise migrations__: Designed for complex environments where password handling varies across regionals, applications, or historical platforms. 

__Why It Matters:__
- Accelerate migrations by reducing friction and avoiding user disruption.
- Lower helpdesk load by minimizing password reset spikes during cutover.
- Increase confidence in large-scale rollouts with flexible support for legacy password formats.

__How to Join EA:__

                   <title>Legacy Management of Connection&amp;apos;s Enabled Clients</title>
                   <pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate>
                   <description>The `enabled_clients` field, within the connection object, is deprecated in the following scenarios:

* [Retrieving multiple connections](https://auth0.com/docs/api/management/v2/connections/get-connections) using (GET - `/api/v2/connections`).
* [Retrieving a connection](https://auth0.com/docs/api/management/v2/connections/get-connections-by-id) using (GET - `/api/v2/connections/{id}`).
* [Updating a connection](https://auth0.com/docs/api/management/v2/connections/patch-connections-by-id) using (PATCH - `/api/v2/connections/{id}`).

As an alternative to the deprecated functionality, two new Management API endpoints are available:

* [Get enabled clients for a connection](https://auth0.com/docs/api/management/v2/connections/get-connection-clients).
* [Update enabled clients for a connection](https://auth0.com/docs/api/management/v2/connections/patch-clients).

We have provided additional information and timelines for enforcing this change across tenants through a dashboard and support center [notification](https://support.auth0.com/notifications/696687215149fab1c3f27f81). It is important to note that when creating a new connection via the (POST - `/api/v2/connections`) endpoint, the `enabled_clients` field remains supported.

                   <title>Ephemeral Sessions with Actions  - General Availability</title>
                   <pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate>
                   <description>As part of our Continuous Session Protection, you can now configure ephemeral (non-persistent) sessions using Actions. This allows enterprise customers to dynamically control whether a session is stored in a persistent cookie or only in memory.

Ephemeral sessions:

*   Exist only in memory and are cleared when the browser or app is closed.
*   Are ideal for high-sensitivity workflows such as step-up authentication or use on public devices.
*   Can be configured per session using `api.session.setCookieMode(&amp;quot;non-persistent&amp;quot;)` in post-login Actions.

This feature, previously in Early Access, is now in **General Availability** and available to all Enterprise tenants.

                   <title>Security Center: Unleash Deeper Insights with New Filtering &amp;amp; Pre-defined Groupings</title>
                   <pubDate>Thu, 18 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate>
                   <description>We&amp;apos;re excited to announce a significant update to the Security Center, marking the first major enhancement since last year&amp;apos;s introduction of Thresholds and Alerts! These new capabilities drastically improve your ability to monitor, analyze, and respond to security threats with greater precision and speed.

__What&amp;apos;s New__:
- __Granular Filtering by Applications and Connections__: You can now filter security metrics within the Overview and Threat Monitoring pages by specific applications and connections. This allows for a more detailed examination of your tenant traffic, enabling faster incident triage and more effective troubleshooting by visualizing subsets of data.

                   <title>Custom Token Exchange now available in Open Early Access</title>
                   <pubDate>Thu, 18 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate>
                   <description>We’re excited to announce the __Open Early Access (EA) of Custom Token Exchange__. OAuth 2.0 Token Exchange allows to trade one security token for another (typically an Access Token). With Custom Token Exchange, you can __run Auth0 Actions as part of that exchange__, giving you a flexible way to inject custom logic and implement your own authentication and authorization semantics. This lets you validate and authorize the request, and precisely set the user for every token exchange transaction.

Key highlights of this release:
- Automatic Entitlement: The feature is now __automatically available to all Enterprise and B2B Pro customers__ to be used for testing and __production__ (no manual enablement required).
- __Organizations Support__: Full compatibility with Organizations. You can now pass the `organization` parameter in the request or use the new `setOrganization` function within your Action.
- Enhanced Security: Includes __Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) support__ during the exchange.

                   <pubDate>Fri, 05 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate>
                   <description>We are excited to announce the release of __Auth0.Aspnetcore.Authentication.Api__, a new official SDK designed to streamline authentication and security for ASP.NET Core backend applications.

__Key Benefits:__
- __Supports .NET 8.0+__ and built for the modern &amp;quot;middleware&amp;quot; pattern. Developers can now secure an API with a single line: builder.Services.AddAuth0ApiAuthentication(...).
- __Abstracts the complexity of JWT validation__. Developers no longer need to write fragile boilerplate code to check Audiences or Issuers. The SDK enforces security best practices out of the box.
- __Supports DPoP__ with flexible enforcement modes (Allowed, Required, Disabled). Enterprise customers can now enforce a higher level of security with minimal code changes.

__Getting Started:__
- [Quickstart](https://auth0.com/docs/quickstart/backend/aspnet-core-webapi)
- [Official Repo](https://github.com/auth0/aspnetcore-api)
- [Examples](https://github.com/auth0/aspnetcore-api/blob/master/EXAMPLES.md)</description>

                   <pubDate>Thu, 04 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate>
                   <description>**Adaptive MFA** now allows administrators to configure **device remembrance durations (TTL)** for the **New Device assessor**. The **default remains at 30 days**, but can now be customized to any value between **1–365 days**.  

When users log in successfully on a remembered device, that device’s TTL automatically refreshes to the currently configured value. 

This enhancement provides greater flexibility to balance **security and user convenience**, helping teams align device remembrance with organizational policies and login patterns.  

Configuration is available through both the **Dashboard** and the **new Adaptive MFA Management API endpoints**, enabling automated setup and management of device remembrance. 

Learn more about configuration options in our [Adaptive MFA documentation](https://auth0.com/docs/secure/multi-factor-authentication/adaptive-mfa/enable-adaptive-mfa#enable-adaptive-mfa).  
For details on the new Adaptive MFA Management API endpoints, visit the [Risk Assessment API documentation](https://auth0.com/docs/api/management/v2/risk-assessments/get-risk-assessments-settings).

                   <pubDate>Tue, 18 Nov 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate>
                   <description>We’ve refined the logic behind how Security Center metrics are calculated to provide more accurate and actionable insights.

Metrics now reflect IP activity using the following logic:

When an IP address triggers more than 10 relevant events for a given metric within a single hour, it will now be counted toward that metric.

This update ensures greater consistency and reliability across event-based metrics within the Security Center.

                   <title>Auth for MCP: Now in Early Access</title>
                   <pubDate>Tue, 18 Nov 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate>
                   <description>Auth0 is thrilled to announce that __Auth for MCP__ is officially in Early Access! This release extends the power of Auth0’s standards-based authorization platform to the Model Context Protocol (MCP), securing your MCP servers, MCP clients, AI agents and the APIs they interact with.

With Auth for MCP, Auth0 integrates OAuth 2.1 and OpenID Connect directly into the MCP ecosystem, ensuring consistent access control and auditability across every agentic interaction.

Key capabilities include:

- MCP Server Authorization: Protect your MCP Servers by leveraging Auth0’s Universal Login to authorize access. You can leverage social, enterprise, and custom identity providers with full support for MFA and advanced attack protection.

- Standards-based discovery and registration: Allow MCP clients and servers to automatically discover authorization endpoints and dynamically register with Auth0. This removes manual setup and ensures consistent configuration across your environment.

- Leveraging your Existing APIs: Enable MCP clients to securely call internal APIs on behalf of users using short-lived, purpose-scoped tokens.

- Connecting to Third party APIs using Token Vault: Securely store, refresh, and revoke access tokens for third-party APIs. This lets your MCP applications act on behalf of users across external SaaS systems like Google, Microsoft, GitHub, and more.

- Developer-ready integration: Explore quickstarts, guides, and sample apps to easily implement Auth for MCP. Auth0 provides ready-to-use examples for securing your MCP server, calling APIs on users’ behalf, and using the Token Vault with JavaScript or Python SDKs.

- MCP Spec Compliance: Works with Auth0’s Resource Parameter Compatibility Profile and token dialect rfc9068_profile_authz, ensuring that access tokens include the permissions claim required for authorization in MCP. 

This Early Access release allows developers to unify authorization across MCP clients, servers, and tools, improving governance of agent actions.

Auth for MCP is available today in Early Access. To participate, please submit the [Early Access Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSferoMH9K1ZasfOqXVByCwwKoL4qOidCIdOtpHXMzUcUibGOQ/viewform) and/or contact your Auth0 Technical Account Manager.

                   <title>Add Session Metadata to Auth0 Sessions</title>
                   <pubDate>Fri, 07 Nov 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate>
                   <description>As part of Continuous Session Protection, you can now attach custom key–value data to a user’s session using Actions or the Auth0 Management API. This allows enterprise customers to persist contextual data (such as device name, organization ID, or custom flags) throughout the session lifecycle.

**Session Metadata:**

Enables storing and retrieving custom metadata directly within Auth0 sessions

Can be set in Post-Login Actions using `api.session.setMetadata(key, value)` and accessed through `event.session.metadata`

Is available via the Management API for reading, updating, or evicting metadata during the session’s lifetime

Can be automatically included in OIDC Back-Channel Logout tokens, enabling downstream systems to receive the same metadata context

This feature expands session extensibility, allowing richer integrations, stronger audit trails, and personalized session behavior across applications.

**Availability:**

Session Metadata is available to Enterprise tenants in Early Access.
To enable this feature, reach out to your Technical Account Manager or open a Support Ticket.

                   <pubDate>Tue, 04 Nov 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate>
                   <description>We’re excited to introduce Google Workspace User Directory Sync, now available as part of our Beta program.

This feature allows organizations to automatically synchronize users from their Google Workspace directory into Auth0 - ensuring user data stays accurate and up to date without relying on login events.

__What’s New:__
- __Automated user synchronization:__ Automatically sync user profiles from your Google Workspace Enterprise connection into Auth0.
- __Flexible sync cadence:__ Choose between manual on-demand syncs or automatic syncs that run every 30 minutes.
- __Custom attribute mapping:__ Map Google Workspace user attributes to Auth0 user profile fields for full control over data consistency.
- __Management API support:__ Configure, update, retrieve, or delete your Directory Sync settings programmatically - with Postman collection templates included.

__Why It Matters:__
This enhancement eliminates the need for users to log in before their profiles are updated in Auth0, reducing data drift and simplifying identity lifecycle management.

__How to Get Started:__
To join the Beta program and access Google Workspace User Directory Sync, complete the Beta Terms &amp;amp; Conditions [form](https://forms.gle/aargNxY1cwmsQv4z5) and contact your Auth0 Account Team to request activation and supporting documentation. </description>

                   <title>Organization Discovery by Domain now in Early Access!</title>
                   <pubDate>Fri, 31 Oct 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate>
                   <description>We’re excited to announce __Organization Discovery by Domain__, a new capability that makes enterprise login smarter and more seamless. Together with __Prompt for Organizations__, it automatically identifies a user’s Organization before authentication, using either their email or organization name — eliminating the need for guessing, manual routing, or dealing with misspellings.

__Smarter Login Experience__: Users can now enter either their organization name or work email on the __Prompt for Organization__ screen. If the Organization has a verified domain, Auth0 detects the Organization instantly, loads the correct branded login, and routes the user to the right IdP.

__Verified Domains__: Tenant admins can now associate one or more verified domains with each Organization using the new Domains tab. Verified domains power automatic organization detection and ensure HRD (Home Realm Discovery) runs only against that Organization’s enabled connections.

__Unified Enterprise Login Flow__: This update enhances the __Prompt for Organization__ experience for both __Business__ and __Both__ (Business + Individual) *app types*, unifying login flows across personal and enterprise users.

__Availability__: Rollout is happening now. No opt-in required, it’s ready as soon as it appears in your tenant.

                   <pubDate>Fri, 31 Oct 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate>
                   <description>We&amp;apos;ve enhanced the [Auth0 FGA Write API](https://docs.fga.dev/api/service#/Relationship%20Tuples/Write) endpoint to help streamline imports and reduce errors. You can now use two new optional parameters:

`on_duplicate: &amp;quot;ignore&amp;quot;`: This will gracefully skip any write operations for relationship tuples that already exist.

`on_missing: &amp;quot;ignore&amp;quot;`: This will gracefully skip any delete operations for relationship tuples that do not exist.

Previously, these common conditions would cause the entire Write request to fail. These new parameters prevent unnecessary failures, eliminating the need for complex client-side retry logic and improving import performance.

This feature is available now via the API and our latest SDKs.

                   <title>Enhanced Signup Bot Detection for Stronger Security and Seamless User Experience</title>
                   <pubDate>Tue, 28 Oct 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate>
                   <description>We’ve improved our **machine learning (ML) model for signup** to deliver stronger protection against automated account creation while keeping friction low for legitimate users.

&amp;gt; **Note:** This update applies **only to the signup flow**. There are **no changes** to the ML models used for bot detection in login or password reset flows.

#### **Highlights of this update include**

- **Expanded detection signals:**  
  The model now leverages **user-agent–based signals**, such as operating system and browser version data, to more accurately distinguish between human and automated signup attempts.

- **Smarter traffic classification:**  
  An **updated labeling strategy** improves how the model differentiates between malicious and legitimate signup activity, helping it adapt more effectively to evolving attack patterns.

- **Optimized sensitivity settings:**  
  Adjusted detection thresholds capture a broader range of bot activity while maintaining a low false positive rate, ensuring a smooth experience for valid users.

#### **What this means for you**

These enhancements strengthen the signup protection capabilities of **Attack Protection**, enabling more effective detection of automated signup attempts without adding unnecessary friction for real users.

The rollout is in progress for all **Enterprise customers with the Attack Protection add-on** and will complete over the coming weeks in line with individual release schedules.

For configuration guidance or to learn more about protecting your signup flows, please refer to our [documentation](https://auth0.com/docs/secure/attack-protection/bot-detection) or contact your account team.

                   <title>Upcoming Changes when using Non-Verifiable Callback URIs</title>
                   <pubDate>Tue, 28 Oct 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate>
                   <description>To enhance security and mitigate risks of application impersonation and phishing attacks, we are **recommending the transition to HTTPS-based callbacks using [Android App Links](https://developer.android.com/training/app-links#android-app-links) and [Apple Universal Links](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/allowing-apps-and-websites-to-link-to-your-content) whenever possible**. In addition, we are introducing a **change in how the service handles custom URI schemes and loopback URI as callbacks**.

More specifically, for authentication requests specifying a custom URI scheme or a loopback URI as the callback, we are introducing a **login confirmation prompt** used in scenarios that would previously return a response without requiring user interaction. For example, in a single sign-on (SSO) scenario, if authentication request requirements can be satisfied from an existing authenticated session, the service will display the new login confirmation prompt instead of seamlessly returning a response to the specified custom URI scheme / loopback URI callback. 

Additionally, authentication requests including `prompt=none` will be rejected when Applications use non-verifiable callback URIs and are configured to use the new login confirmation prompt.

**Review the User Confirmation Prompt section of [Measures Against Application Impersonation](https://auth0.com/docs/secure/security-guidance/measures-against-app-impersonation) to learn more about the new prompt**.

Tenants created before **October 15, 2025**, maintain the previous behavior as the default until **April 28, 2026**. After the October cutoff date, newly created tenants may default to displaying the new login confirmation prompt with some exceptions due to each environment&amp;apos;s deployment schedule. For any tenant maintaining the previous behavior, we recommend you opt in beforehand to use the new behavior. Alternatively, you can opt out of using the additional confirmation prompt if strictly required. Additional **information on this situation is available at [Migrate to Custom URI Scheme Redirect End-User Confirmation](https://auth0.com/docs/troubleshoot/product-lifecycle/deprecations-and-migrations/non-verifiable-callback-uri-end-user-confirmation)**.

                   <title>Easily Update Your Firewall with the New IP Allow List</title>
                   <pubDate>Fri, 10 Oct 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate>
                   <description>We are excited to announce an improvement that makes it faster and easier for you to keep your firewall configurations up-to-date.

Our __IP allow list for Auth0&amp;apos;s Public Cloud regions__ is now available in a standardized, machine-readable format. This new format is designed to help you automate updates and ensure the most accurate configuration for your firewall.

What this means for you:
- __Automation__: You can now programmatically fetch and parse the list, eliminating the need for manual updates.
- __Accuracy__: The structured data ensures you&amp;apos;re always using the latest and most accurate IP addresses.
- __Clarity__: The changelogs highlight specific additions and removals, so you can easily see what has been updated.

You can access this information at: [https://cdn.auth0.com/ip-ranges.json](https://cdn.auth0.com/ip-ranges.json)

For more details, please see our documentation on [IP allow list](https://auth0.com/docs/secure/security-guidance/data-security/allowlist).</description>

                   <title>Audience Validation for Private Key JWT Client Authentication</title>
                   <pubDate>Fri, 10 Oct 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate>
                   <description>When validating [JWT assertions used for client application authentication](https://auth0.com/docs/get-started/authentication-and-authorization-flow/authenticate-with-private-key-jwt), **Auth0 will impose stricter requirements and accept only a tenant&amp;apos;s issuer identifier as a single JSON string value in the &amp;quot;aud&amp;quot; (audience) claim**.

The possibility of providing an &amp;quot;aud&amp;quot; claim with either one of the approaches listed below is deprecated, and at a future date will cause the service to consider such JWT assertions invalid:
* A JSON array of strings, provided that one of the entries contains a valid issuer identifier or endpoint URL for the respective tenant and endpoint the client authenticates against.
* A single JSON string representing a valid endpoint URL for the respective tenant and endpoint the client authenticates against.

OIDC enterprise connections configured to use Private Key JWT in authenticated requests to the upstream identity provider will also be able to use the applicable issuer identifier represented as a JSON string in the &amp;quot;aud&amp;quot; claim included in JWT assertions.

We have provided additional information and timelines for enforcing this change across tenants through a dashboard and [support center notification](https://support.auth0.com/notifications/68e3e29a45f175778e64b020).</description>

                   <title>Akamai Supplemental Signals is Now in Early Access</title>
                   <pubDate>Wed, 08 Oct 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate>
                   <description>We’re excited to announce the Early Access release of **Akamai Supplemental Signals**. This feature allows **Auth0 Enterprise customers who have Akamai configured as a reverse proxy** in front of Auth0 to forward signals from [**Akamai Bot Manager**](https://www.akamai.com/products/bot-manager) and [**Akamai Account Protector**](https://www.akamai.com/products/account-protector) into Auth0.

With this integration, you can enrich your authentication flows with supplemental signals from Akamai and make more dynamic security decisions in post-login Actions and gain visibility through tenant logs.

---

### Key Benefits

- **Combined Risk Context:** Leverage Akamai’s bot and user risk signals together with Auth0’s risk assessment for a more complete view of login risk.  

- **Adaptive Security Controls:** Combine Akamai and Auth0 risk signals to trigger MFA, deny sessions, or revoke access based on risk indicators.  

- **Seamless Integration:** Configure Akamai to forward signals and use them immediately in post-login Actions and tenant logs.  

---

### Availability

- Available to all **Enterprise customers using Akamai as a reverse proxy** in front of Auth0.  

- Currently in **Early Access**.

                   <title>Additional Signing Algorithms for OIDC and Okta Enterprise Connections in Limited Early Access!</title>
                   <pubDate>Thu, 02 Oct 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate>
                   <description>We’re thrilled to introduce the __Limited Early Access__ release of __Additional Signing Algorithm for Okta and OIDC enterprise connections__! This release expands flexibility for both __Private Key JWT client authentication__ and __ID token verification__ by adding support for stronger signing algorithms beyond RS256, including: 
- RS512
- PS256
- ES256

For Private Key JWT, Auth0 now lets you choose which algorithm is used to sign client assertion JWTs when authenticating requests to an upstream IdP. For ID token verification, Auth0 can validate tokens signed with a wider set of algorithms, ensuring compatibility across OIDC flows. Together, these enhancements give customers more control over cryptographic choices, making it easier to align with security policies and adapt as standards evolve

This release is currently rolling out to all environments. To enable the Additional Signing Algorithms Limited Early Access release in your Auth0 tenant once available in your environment, please contact your Technical Account Manager to request access.</description>

                   <pubDate>Wed, 01 Oct 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate>
                   <description>As part of the Continuous Session Protection, you can now configure ephemeral (non-persistent) sessions using Actions. This allows enterprise customers to dynamically control whether a session is stored in a persistent cookie or only in memory.

Ephemeral sessions:
- Exist only in memory and are cleared when the browser or app is closed
- Are ideal for high-sensitivity workflows such as step-up authentication or use on public devices
- Can be configured per session using `api.session.setCookieMode(&amp;quot;non-persistent&amp;quot;)` in post-login Actions

This feature is available to all Enterprise tenants in Public Early Access and requires no enrolment.

This ensures consistent data handling across integrations and simplifies ongoing maintenance. Furthermore, when using UAP with the Self-Service Profile and Self-Service SSO, those mappings are now used to populate the Enterprise Connection Mapping object in Auth0.  

__Key Benefits__
- __Automation__: Delegate SCIM setup to your customers’ admins
- __Interoperability__: Works seamlessly across varied IdPs
- __Consistency__: One schema for easier debugging and support
- __Flexibility__: Override mappings per protocol when needed

You can now combine these steps into a single action. When inviting a new team member, an optional step in the invitation modal allows you to pre-select the tenants and associated roles the invitee should automatically access upon accepting the invitation.

__Key Benefits for Your Team ✅__:

- One-Step Onboarding: Reduce administrative overhead by combining invitation and tenant access assignment into one efficient workflow.
- Immediate Access: Invitees gain immediate access to pre-assigned tenants upon accepting the invitation, eliminating waiting periods.
- Improved Audibility: Team Activity logs now record &amp;quot;Invitation accepted&amp;quot; events for better visibility along with tenant member event detail logs.

This feature empowers Team Owners to onboard administrators and contributors effortlessly, ensuring they have the right access from day one.

__Availability 🍾__: Available in Early Access to Enterprise Customers, with General Availability coming soon.

                   <title>Auth0 Teams Tenant Member Management and SSO enforcement for Private Cloud (Beta)</title>
                   <pubDate>Wed, 20 Aug 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate>
                   <description>We are excited to announce a major update for our Private Cloud customers, extending the powerful management and security capabilities of Auth0 Teams to your private cloud environments. This release introduces the Beta versions of Tenant Member Management and SSO Enforcement, closing the feature gap with our Public Cloud offering.

## ✨ New Features

__Tenant Member Management (Beta) for Private Cloud__:

You can now centrally manage tenant membership and roles for your team members directly from the Auth0 Teams dashboard. This feature simplifies user administration by allowing you to:
- View and manage all tenant access from a single interface.
- Efficiently onboard and off-board users across multiple tenants.
- Perform bulk operations to grant or revoke access.

__SSO Enforcement (Beta) for Private Cloud__:

Strengthen your organization&amp;apos;s security posture by requiring all team and tenant members to authenticate using one of your configured Enterprise Identity Provider (IdP) connections. This ensures that access to Auth0 resources is governed by your corporate identity solution.

__Activity Log Integration for Tenant Management__:

All operations related to Tenant Member Management (e.g., adding, updating or deleting) are now recorded in the Auth0 Teams Activity Log, providing a complete audit trail for compliance and security monitoring. 
(**Note** Now available to all Auth0 Teams customers.)

__Session Revocation for Private Cloud__:

Administrators now have the ability to revoke active user sessions for Private Cloud tenants, providing an immediate way to off-board users or respond to security events.

## 📈 Improvements

__Streamlined Private Cloud User Invites__:

Team members can now be invited directly to a Private Cloud tenant through the Teams interface. This removes the previous requirement of first adding the user to the configuration tenant, simplifying and accelerating the onboarding workflow.

__Increased Bulk Tenant__:

The limit for bulk tenant assignment has been doubled, allowing you to grant or modify access to 10 tenants at once, up from the previous limit of 5.

## Beta Program Information
Tenant Member Management and SSO Enforcement features for Private Cloud are being released in Beta.

                   <title>Sender constrained tokens using DPoP is now available in Early Access.</title>
                   <pubDate>Tue, 19 Aug 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate>
                   <description>We are delighted to announce that support for sender constraining tokens using Demonstrating Proof of Possession (DPoP) is now available in Early Access. 

Demonstrating Proof of Possession (DPoP) as defined in RFC9449, is an application level mechanism for binding tokens issued by Auth0 to the client application that requested that token. This is implemented using asymmetric key cryptography and with keys that are generated and managed by the client application - no public key infrastructure (PKI) is required.

Sender constraining tokens using DPoP can be used to mitigate the risk of tokens being used by unauthorised parties if they are intercepted in transit or exfiltrated from applications. This helps to:
 - enhance security by mitigating against token theft and misuse by unauthorised parties
 - improve user experience by being able to use longer-lived access tokens without significantly increasing security risk i.e. not requiring frequent user authentication

Auth0 will be rolling out SDK support for DPoP for native applications, single page applications, backend server APIs, and Auth0 management: 
 - SDKs for iOS Swift and Android Kotlin are available now.
 - SDKs for Javascript, React, Python and more are coming soon.

To evaluate DPoP for securing your tokens, contact your Auth0 representative. For more details, check out our [product documentation](https://auth0.com/docs/secure/sender-constraining/demonstrating-proof-of-possession-dpop).</description>

                   <title>JA3 and JA4 TLS Fingerprints Now Available in Tenant Logs and Actions</title>
                   <pubDate>Mon, 18 Aug 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate>
                   <description>We have expanded our security telemetry to include **JA3** and **JA4 TLS fingerprints**. **TLS fingerprinting** is a proven technique for identifying client software based on the TLS handshake.  

- **JA3** is a fingerprinting method that identifies TLS clients based on their connection parameters.  
- **JA4** refines TLS fingerprinting to make client identification more stable and resilient to small variations.  

These signals help customers detect and respond to **malicious traffic** faster, identify suspicious client behavior, and correlate related activity across changing IPs and sessions.  

---

## **What’s New**  

**Tenant Logs**  
JA3 and JA4 fingerprints are now logged in applicable authentication and security events such as **`Success Login`**, **`Failed Login`**, and **`Anomaly Detection`**.  

**Actions Integration**  
JA3 and JA4 fingerprints are now available in **Actions** for real-time, custom security responses, but **only in the following triggers**:  
- `pre-user-registration`  
- `post-user-registration`  
- `post-login`  

**Tenant Access Control List (ACL) Support**  
You can also use the [Tenant Access Control List](https://auth0.com/docs/secure/tenant-access-control-list) to block specific TLS fingerprints directly by adding a rule. Alternatively, you can combine JA3 and JA4 signals with Actions to apply custom business logic, such as requiring MFA or conditionally denying access.  

---

## **Why It Matters**  
JA3 and JA4 provide a **stable, high-entropy signal** that is hard to spoof, helping you correlate malicious activity even across changing IPs and sessions.  

---

## **Availability**  
Available for all **Enterprise** customers. Start using these signals today.

                   <title>Actions - Transaction Metadata (EA)</title>
                   <pubDate>Tue, 12 Aug 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate>
                   <description>We are excited to announce that __Actions Transaction Metadata__ is now available in [__Early Access__](https://auth0.com/docs/troubleshoot/product-lifecycle/product-release-stages#early-access &amp;quot;Early Access&amp;quot;).

This feature allows developers to set, share, and access, custom data between Actions run in the same `post-login` execution.

__Early Access__ functionality includes:
- __Accessing Transaction Metadata:__ A new `event.transaction.metadata` object within `post-login` Actions that contains the custom `key/value` pairs, which can be accessed through `key`.
- __Setting Transaction Metadata:__ A new `api.transaction.setMetadata` function within `post-login` Actions that serves as interface to set the custom `key/value` pairs.
- __Immediate Access:__ Values are available immediately after being set in the calling Action and subsequent Actions.
- __Values Types:__ Values can be `boolean`, `number`, `string`, or `string` serialization of `object` and `array`.
- __Docs:__
  - New docs section at: [https://auth0.com/docs/customize/actions/transaction-metadata](https://auth0.com/docs/customize/actions/transaction-metadata &amp;quot;Actions Transaction Metadata Docs&amp;quot;)
  - Updated guidelines at: [https://auth0.com/docs/customize/actions/action-coding-guidelines#actions-basics](https://auth0.com/docs/customize/actions/action-coding-guidelines#actions-basics &amp;quot;Actions Coding Guidelines&amp;quot;)</description>

                   <title>Upcoming Removal of Legacy Management API Swagger Endpoint on September 11, 2025</title>
                   <pubDate>Tue, 12 Aug 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate>
                   <description>Starting on September 11, 2025, we will be deprecating and removing the legacy, undocumented Management API Swagger Specification.
### What is changing?
On September 11 2025, the endpoint path /api/v2/api-docs/ will be removed. After this date, any requests made to this path will result in a 404 Not Found error.
### Why are we making this change?
Please note that this endpoint and the Swagger specification it provides were never officially documented or intended for public use. The current Swagger specification available at this endpoint is unmaintained, undocumented, and does not reflect the full capabilities of our Management API. As part of our commitment to providing robust and reliable tools, we are removing this legacy specification to prevent confusion and potential issues.

We strongly encourage all users to migrate to our officially supported [OpenAPI 3.1 Specification for the Management API](https://auth0.com/docs/api/management/v2), which is currently in Beta. This new specification is actively maintained and provides a more accurate and comprehensive development experience.
### What do you need to do?
If any of your processes are calling the /api/v2/api-docs/ endpoints, take the following steps before September 11, 2025 to ensure your applications and services continue to function without interruption:
1. Identify any systems, scripts, or CI/CD processes that access https://[your-tenant.yourdomain.com]/api/v2/api-docs/.
2. Update these systems to use our new, officially supported OpenAPI 3.1 specification. It can be accessed here: &amp;lt;https://auth0.com/docs/api/management/v2&amp;gt;
3. Ensure your applications are resilient to a 404 Not Found response from the old endpoint path.

If the above does not address your needs or you have additional questions, contact us using the [Auth0 by Okta Support Center](https://support.auth0.com/) or [Auth0 by Okta Community](https://community.auth0.com).

- Support for defining audience-specific refresh token policies per client
- Use one refresh token to request tokens for multiple APIs — no re-authentication required
- Compatible with rotating and expiring refresh tokens
- First-party applications only 
- Management API support available today
- iOS and Android SDKs support
- Auth0 Deploy CLI and Terraform Support

                   <title>Flexibility for Passwordless on Universal Login with Connection Switching</title>
                   <pubDate>Mon, 11 Aug 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate>
                   <description>We&amp;apos;re introducing a new feature that gives your end-users the flexibility to choose how they log in. Using Universal Login Custom Prompts, you can now add custom buttons to your login pages. This empowers your users to easily switch between a traditional database (password-based) connection and a passwordless (OTP-based) connection.

This update allows you to create a seamless experience where users can select their preferred authentication method directly from the login challenge screen.

                   <title>Native to Web SSO – Now in Early Access for all Enterprise customers</title>
                   <pubDate>Mon, 11 Aug 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate>
                   <description>We’re excited to announce the __Early Access of Native to Web SSO is now available for all enterprise customers__.

With this release, developers can:

- Implement SSO from native iOS or Android apps to browser-based web apps.
- Securely issue and consume Session Transfer Tokens.
- Leverage device binding enforcement (IP or ASN) for additional security.
- Access Session Transfer Token support in Auth0 Actions.
- Use the feature across the Auth0 CLI SDK, Terraform Provider, Deploy CLI, and native mobile SDKs (iOS and Android).
- Integrate with WS-FED and SAML clients, and invoke Post Login Actions during token consumption.

                   <title>Enhanced Bot Detection Accuracy and Reduced Friction</title>
                   <pubDate>Thu, 07 Aug 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate>
                   <description>We’ve improved our bot detection model to strike a better balance between **security and user experience**, with specific gains for tenants whose users frequently access resources via VPN.

**Highlights of this update include:**

* **Reduced false positives for VPN users:** The model now more effectively distinguishes between legitimate users and bots, even when traffic originates from shared IPs or anonymized networks.

* **Improved user experience without compromising security:** These updates are designed to reduce unnecessary friction for valid users while maintaining strong defenses against automated threats.

This enhanced security capability is now available to all **Enterprise customers with the Attack Protection add-on**. The rollout is currently underway and will be completed over the coming weeks in alignment with individual customer release schedules.

For activation details or to learn more about protecting your applications, please refer to our [documentation](https://auth0.com/docs/secure/attack-protection/bot-detection) or contact your account team. We&amp;apos;re committed to helping you stay secure in an evolving threat landscape.</description>

                   <pubDate>Thu, 07 Aug 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate>
                   <description>__What changed:__ When the user&amp;apos;s email is available, Auth0 will now send an email notification for brute‑force blocks in all identifier scenarios (e.g., phone, username), supplementing existing delivery rules.

__Why it matters:__ Ensures users receive blocking notifications consistently even when logging in via phone or username, improving visibility and response.

                   <pubDate>Thu, 31 Jul 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate>
                   <description>Introducing a new capability for log streaming: *__PII Masking__*.  

This feature allows customers to obfuscate (hash or mask) sensitive personal identifiable information (e.g., email address, phone number, username, etc.) within their log streams. This enhancement improves security and compliance for customers who stream their logs to data lakes or third-party tools.

Key Features:
- __Customizable PII Masking__: Customers can select specific PII data to be masked in their log streams.
- __Enhanced Security and Compliance__: This capability helps customers meet stricter compliance requirements by providing greater control over sensitive data in their logs.
- __Broad Applicability__: PII masking will be available for both new and existing log streams.

This update aligns with Auth0&amp;apos;s commitment to improving customer data security and providing more customization in log stream outputs

                   <title>Cascade Token and Session Revocation for Native to Web SSO is Now Available</title>
                   <pubDate>Tue, 22 Jul 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate>
                   <description>We’ve added support for **Cascade Revocation** in **Native to Web SSO**.

With this new capability, revoking the **original refresh token** used in a Native to Web flow will now **automatically revoke all dependent web sessions and their issued refresh tokens**.

This helps prevent stale or orphaned sessions and ensures that once the root token is no longer valid, all downstream access is properly revoked.

---

## What’s new:

- **`enable_cascade_revocation`**  
  When enabled, revoking a native app’s refresh token also revokes all web sessions and refresh tokens created via `session_transfer_token`.

- **`enable_online_refresh_tokens`**  
  When enabled, refresh tokens issued during a Native to Web SSO flow are tied to the lifetime of their associated session (i.e., online tokens).

---

## Default behavior:

Both of these settings are **enabled by default**, even when not explicitly configured.

This means:
- All clients using Native to Web SSO today already benefit from **cascade revocation**.
- Web-issued refresh tokens will **automatically expire** when their sessions expire.

You can manage or override these settings using the [Auth0 Management API](https://auth0.com/docs/api/management/v2#!/Clients/patch_clients_by_id).

---

## Why it matters:

This update provides stronger guarantees around **token lifecycle** and **session integrity** across platforms:

- Prevents misuse of refresh tokens after logout or revocation  
- Reduces risk from long-lived sessions in embedded web views  
- Helps developers maintain a tighter, more secure cross-platform SSO experience

                   <pubDate>Mon, 21 Jul 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate>
                   <description>We are excited to introduce expanded passkey support for custom database connections! Now available without enabling import mode.

__What’s New:__
- You can now enable passkey-based authentication for custom database connections without importing or trickle-migrating users into Auth0 (i.e., with import mode turned off).
- End users can easily enroll in passkeys after their first successful login, requiring no prior passkey credentials in your external identity store.
- Passkey credentials are securely stored in Auth0, while your external identity store continues to handle all other authentication logic.

This enhancement unlocks frictionless, passkey-based login experiences for enterprises that manage user credentials outside of Auth0 - without requiring user migration or changes to existing identity architecture. 

To enable the Limited Early Access release in your Auth0 tenant, contact your Technical Account Manager to request access.

                   <title>Early Access Launch of Right-to-Left Language Support for Universal Login!</title>
                   <pubDate>Thu, 10 Jul 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate>
                   <description>Today, we&amp;apos;re excited to announce the __Early Access release of Right-to-Left (RTL) Language Support for Universal Login__—with support for the Guardian Mobile Apps (iOS &amp;amp; Android) coming later this month. 

![RTL EA Changelog Banner](//images.ctfassets.net/kbkgmx9upatd/7qs9OXnfpfRyrSczKCAow6/d4474f6fd3c00626a759d15a33934aa8/RTL_Banner.jpg)

This update expands Auth0’s global accessibility by enabling seamless support for RTL languages, including __Arabic, Persian (Farsi), Hebrew, and Urdu__—helping you deliver more inclusive, intuitive login experiences in regions where these languages are the norm. Supporting RTL languages means you can reach new markets, localize experiences with greater precision, and improve accessibility for the nearly 1 billion people who rely on RTL scripts.

Early Access includes managing RTL languages in the Admin Dashboard and API as well as previewing and editing prompt translations. Guardian support (coming later this month) will bring RTL layout rendering to identity verification and MFA workflows.

This release marks a major step forward for Universal Login. As Auth0 continues to pursue our vision of a world where anyone can safely use any technology, powered by their Identity, we are proud to partner with our customers around the world in delivering secure, inclusive, and accessible authentication experiences. 

Contact your Auth0 account manager or Auth0 Support to enable Early Access on your tenant.</description>

                   <title>Multiple Actions for Custom Phone and Email Provider Triggers</title>
                   <pubDate>Mon, 30 Jun 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate>
                   <description>We are deprecating the ability to create more than one action per tenant for actions supporting custom phone or email providers and introducing a maximum limit of one action in the respective triggers:
* `custom-phone-provider`
* `custom-email-provider`

This limitation applies to the Management API [create an action endpoint](https://auth0.com/docs/api/management/v2/actions/post-action) (POST - `/api/v2/actions/actions`) and can impact integrations performing direct API calls and tools like the [Auth0 Deploy CLI](https://auth0.com/docs/deploy-monitor/deploy-cli-tool), the [Auth0 Terraform Provider](https://auth0.com/docs/deploy-monitor/auth0-terraform-provider), or the [Auth0 CLI](https://auth0.github.io/auth0-cli/).

We have provided additional information and timelines for enforcing this change across tenants through a dashboard and [support center notification](https://support.auth0.com/notifications/68503aec14369f07548fbb58).

                   <title>Improved bot detection with reduced friction for legitimate users</title>
                   <pubDate>Fri, 27 Jun 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate>
                   <description>We’ve upgraded our bot detection model to improve accuracy and reduce friction for legitimate users, particularly on mobile devices and evolving browser platforms.

**Highlights of this update include:**

* **Improved interpretation of user-agent signals**: The model now better handles previously unseen browser and OS versions, improving accuracy in distinguishing between legitimate users and malicious traffic.

* **Reduced friction for mobile users**: We&amp;apos;ve updated the model to more accurately recognize native mobile app traffic, resulting in fewer unnecessary CAPTCHA challenges for real users.

* **Improved user experience without compromising security**: These changes are designed to reduce false positives while maintaining robust bot detection coverage.

This enhanced security feature is available now to all **Enterprise customers with the Attack Protection add-on**. The rollout is currently underway and will be completed in the coming weeks, aligned with individual customer release schedules.

For activation details or to learn more about safeguarding your systems, please refer to our [documentation](https://auth0.com/docs/secure/attack-protection/bot-detection) or reach out to your account team. We are committed to supporting you in protecting your digital presence against evolving threats.</description>

                   <pubDate>Tue, 24 Jun 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate>
                   <description>We’re excited to announce that the Okta AI-powered chatbot ([Guide](https://auth0.com/docs/get-started/auth0-guide)) Early Access offering has been enhanced with an additional data source - __Security Center Metric Data__. This additional capability is available only to Enterprise customers and can answer questions such as “do I have more sign up attacks this week compared to last week?”.

### Availability

Guide is available to tenants in the US Public Cloud region. Within that group, Security Center Metric Data is available only for Enterprise customers. Guide will be rolled out to all Public Cloud regions in the near future.</description>

                   <title>Private Key JWT Client Authentication for OIDC and Okta Enterprise Connections - Now in Early Access</title>
                   <pubDate>Mon, 23 Jun 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate>
                   <description>We’re excited to announce the Early Access release of Private Key JWT Client Authentication for OIDC and Okta Enterprise Connections! Auth0 customers can now leverage a more secure and standards-based method of client authentication for their enterprise identity providers.

Until now, federated connections relied on long-lived client secrets for back-channel authentication. This feature enables signing with asymmetric keys on Okta and OIDC connections, reducing the risk of credential leakage and enabling secure key management and rotation.

While Auth0 already supports Private Key JWT when acting as the Identity Provider, this release extends that security posture to outbound enterprise connections, allowing Auth0 to securely authenticate to upstream IdPs using signed JWTs instead of shared secrets.

For complete setup instructions and more, refer to our [documentation](https://auth0.com/docs/authenticate/enterprise-connections/private-key-jwt-client-auth).

By using Private Key JWT Client Authentication on your OIDC and Okta Enterprise Connections, you agree to the applicable Free Trial terms in Okta’s Master Subscription Agreement and [Okta’s Privacy Policy](https://www.okta.com/privacy-policy/) during use of the Early Access feature. The Free Trial terms can be found within the [Master Subscription Agreement](https://www.okta.com/agreements).</description>

                   <title>Multi-Resource Refresh Tokens (MRRT) Now Available in Early Access</title>
                   <pubDate>Mon, 23 Jun 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate>
                   <description>We’re excited to announce that Multi-Resource Refresh Tokens (MRRT) is now in Early Access for Enterprise customers.

This feature allows applications to use a single refresh token to request access tokens for multiple resource servers (APIs), each with its own audience and scopes. MRRT simplifies token lifecycle management, enhances developer experience, and improves session continuity across distributed API architectures.

What’s New?
- Support for defining audience-specific refresh token policies per client
- Use one refresh token to request tokens for multiple APIs — no re-authentication required
- Compatible with rotating and expiring refresh tokens
- First-party applications only 
- Management API support available today
- iOS and Android SDKs support
- Auth0 Deploy CLI and Terraform Support

                   <title>Removal of Access to Specific Event Request Properties in Actions</title>
                   <pubDate>Wed, 18 Jun 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate>
                   <description>#### What is changing?
The service will restrict access to additional property names within the `event.request.query` and `event.request.body` objects when executing actions for the `post-login` and `credentials-exchange` triggers. Tenants identified as using actions that may reference request properties planned for restriction will maintain access until **September 16, 2025**.

The service will restrict the following property names in the request-related objects:
- `auth_session`
- `authn_response`
- `client_secret`
- `client_assertion`
- `refresh_token`

Previously, the implementation of an action could access the properties listed above in `event.request.query` and `event.request.body` to retrieve the value included in the corresponding network request. Once the planned restrictions become effective for a given tenant, all properties above will be undefined independently of the network request content.

The rollout of these additional restrictions is in progress for tenants where historical data did not show any actions using these property names. Tenants identified as potentially impacted by these restrictions will maintain existing behavior until the previously mentioned date.

#### Why are we making this change?
By restricting access to these properties, we aim to prevent potential mishandling of sensitive data within the custom code implemented for `post-login` and `credentials-exchange` actions. For example, we reduce the risk of unintentionally logging sensitive data in log operations that may output the whole request object.

#### How are you affected?
If any of your tenant&amp;apos;s current actions no longer include any reference to one of the restricted property names or that despite having references to one of the names, it is not in the context of property access to `event.request.query` and `event.request.body` objects, then these changes should not impact your tenant.

If there are actual references to restricted request properties, the restriction of these properties may impact the action&amp;apos;s logic. After the changes become effective, accessing those request properties will always return undefined. Without revising the actions&amp;apos; implementation, the respective authentication flows risk partial degradation or complete failure.

#### What action do you need to take?
If your tenants currently have actions referencing one of the restricted properties of the `event.request.query` and `event.request.body` objects in their implementation. For applicable actions, you must update their implementation to stop relying on the restricted properties of the request objects.

The exact implementation changes you may need to perform will depend on your overall implementation of the actions and each restricted request property&amp;apos;s usage scenario.

For example, for scenarios related to reusing secret information previously available from the request, the support for [secret management](https://auth0.com/docs/customize/actions/write-your-first-action#add-a-secret) (`event.secrets`) as part of actions may provide a potential alternative. If the requests include restricted property names, but the information sent within them is not considered sensitive, you may consider using a different parameter name in the request, or ideally, consider using [custom parameters](https://auth0.com/docs/get-started/authentication-and-authorization-flow/authorization-code-flow/authorization-code-flow-with-par#supported-parameters) as part of [pushed authorization requests](https://auth0.com/docs/get-started/applications/configure-par) to avoid disclosing/interception of the data by end-users in browser-based flows. If the data is static per client or connection, consider storing it as part of client or connection metadata.</description>

                   <title>Real-time Webtasks Logs Extension Deprecation</title>
                   <pubDate>Wed, 18 Jun 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate>
                   <description>#### What is changing?
We are deprecating the Real-time Webtask Logs extension with a planned end-of-life after (EOL) **September 16, 2025**. 

As a replacement, we have published the [Actions Real-time Logs](https://auth0.com/docs/customize/actions/actions-real-time-logs) feature integrated within the Auth0 Dashboard. The extension will cease to be available for new installations, but tenants with the extension already installed will maintain access until the planned EOL.

#### Why are we making this change?
The transition to the dashboard will improve the security posture and maintainability of the functionality, while simplifying future enhancements.

#### How are you affected?
For active users of the Real-time Webtask Logs extension, its scheduled removal will affect you, as the transition from extension to a direct dashboard capability inherently implies some user experience differences.

#### What action do you need to take?
You can start using the [Actions Real-time Logs](https://auth0.com/docs/customize/actions/actions-real-time-logs#how-to-use) feature by navigating to **Auth0 Dashboard** &amp;gt; **Monitoring** &amp;gt; **Actions Logs**. 

We recommend that extension users familiarize themselves with the new user interface to avoid disruption once the extension becomes unavailable.

                   <pubDate>Tue, 17 Jun 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate>
                   <description>Auth0 is excited to announce the General Availability of Private Cloud Restoration resilience enhancement. This capability would come handy in the event of customer data loss or data corruption, and would assist customers in meeting regulatory requirements such as European Union’s Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA).

This capability allows customers to request full restoration of their production Private Cloud environment from an Auth0 backup in the last 14 days. It also includes the option for one restoration test per year on a non-production Private Cloud environment. Please refer to [Operational policies documentation](https://auth0.com/docs/troubleshoot/customer-support/operational-policies#private-cloud-restoration &amp;quot;Private Cloud Restoration&amp;quot;) for more.</description>

                   <pubDate>Fri, 13 Jun 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate>
                   <description>You can now customize the __Brute-Force Protection unblock page__ using Universal Login. This update allows for a fully branded experience when users are locked out due to repeated failed login attempts.

__What’s New?__
- __Branded unblock experience via Universal Login -__
 The brute-force protection unblock page is now part of Universal Login, giving you full control over its appearance and content. This ensures a seamless, branded experience throughout the recovery flow.

- __Improved compatibility with email security scanners -__
 Account unblock now occurs when the unblock page loads rather than on clicking the unblock link. This helps prevent issues caused by email security scanners that pre-process links.

__To enable these new features__

Navigate to __Settings__ &amp;gt; __Advanced__ tab
In the __Migrations__ section, near the bottom of the page, disable the existing functionality with the toggle shown below

![Brute Force Deprecation Toggle](//images.ctfassets.net/kbkgmx9upatd/aq1x1nHXvy3b9nEcvNyGE/8b4e39918582a1f4250f42c2efe43618/DeprecationScreenShot.png)

The existing __Brute-Force Protection unblock page and behavior__ will remain available for now. However, it is __planned for deprecation within the next 6 months__, giving you __ample time to transition__ to the __new and improved experience__ at your convenience.

For more information about our __Brute-Force Protection__ feature, see our online documentation [here](https://auth0.com/docs/secure/attack-protection/brute-force-protection)

                   <title>Native to Web SSO – Now in Early Access</title>
                   <pubDate>Mon, 02 Jun 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate>
                   <description>We’re excited to announce the Early Access release of Native to Web SSO — a new capability that enables session sharing between native mobile apps and web apps using a secure, standards-based approach. This helps create a seamless user experience where authentication in one platform (native or web) carries over to the other, without requiring a separate login.

With this release, developers can:

- Implement SSO from native iOS or Android apps to browser-based web apps.
- Securely issue and consume Session Transfer Tokens.
- Leverage device binding enforcement (IP or ASN) for additional security.
- Access Session Transfer Token support in Auth0 Actions.
- Use the feature across the Auth0 CLI SDK, Terraform Provider, Deploy CLI, and native mobile SDKs (iOS and Android).
- Integrate with WS-FED and SAML clients, and invoke Post Login Actions during token consumption.

                   <pubDate>Thu, 29 May 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate>
                   <description>We’ve excited to announce that Fine-Grained M2M Token Quotas is now in __Early Access for Enterprise customers__.

This feature allows __setting hourly and daily limits on M2M access tokens at the Application and Organization level__. __When a quota is reached, affected Applications receive 429 responses until the quota resets__. Customers can also enable or disable quotas in real time and monitor usage via tenant logs and HTTP headers.

![M2M token quota error](//images.ctfassets.net/kbkgmx9upatd/4WFjgTHnAXtwxaw6FvVtUk/d79cad77dc6eed76196a5ff4c20c81e4/Screenshot_2025-05-29_at_11.11.41.png)

This gives customers granular control over token issuance, helping __prevent excessive consumption — especially important when APIs are exposed to Third-Party Apps__ or internal teams outside their direct control. It addresses common issues like missing token caching, which can lead to uncontrolled token usage, unexpected costs and imbalanced usage across Organizations.

                   <title>Client-Initiated Backchannel Authentication (CIBA) flow is now Generally Available</title>
                   <pubDate>Wed, 21 May 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate>
                   <description>Asynchronous authentication and authorisation using the Client-Initiated Backchannel Authentication (CIBA) flow is now Generally Available for our Enterprise plan customers. The CIBA flow works as an asynchronous, decoupled flow across two different devices: 

 - Consumption device: initiates the authentication request.

 - Authentication device: handles end-user authentication, implemented as a custom mobile app which embeds the Guardian mobile SDK.

The flow supports the use of Rich Authorization Requests [RFC9396](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9396.html) to provide contextual information to authenticating and/or authorizing users. This enables the CIBA flow to support a number of powerful use cases driven by backend client applications, such as: 

 - Customer authentication by headless devices or devices/applications with limited interaction capabilities.

 - Customer authentication in call-centre scenarios.

 - Authorising sensitive operations on behalf of yourself or a third-party e.g. a customer service Agent, an autonomous AI Agent.

For more details, see the [product documentation](https://auth0.com/docs/get-started/authentication-and-authorization-flow/client-initiated-backchannel-authentication-flow).</description>

                   <title>Edit Tenant Member roles from within Auth0 Teams</title>
                   <pubDate>Tue, 20 May 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate>
                   <description>We&amp;apos;re excited to announce a significant enhancement to the Tenant Member Management feature within Auth0 Teams. All tenant member management tasks can now be completed centrally within the Auth0 Teams Dashboard.

Previously, we introduced tenant member management with support for inviting and assigning dashboard users to team tenants, followed by the ability to remove access from tenants directly within the Teams dashboard.

With this release, a team owner gains the comprehensive ability to perform all Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) tasks on tenant members directly from the Teams Dashboard. This streamlines administrative workflows and provides unparalleled control over user access across your tenants.

Note: The Tenant Member Management feature is required for this functionality. This feature is on by default for all Self-Service customers and most Public Cloud Enterprise customers. It is configurable for some existing Public Cloud Enterprise customers and is coming soon to Private Cloud customers.

Please refer to the following documentation for more information.

                   <pubDate>Wed, 16 Apr 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate>
                   <description>We’re excited to introduce Token Vault, now available in Early Access. Token Vault enables your applications to securely access third-party APIs on behalf of your users—without requiring you to manage refresh tokens or create custom integrations for a broad range of external APIs and services.

With Token Vault, Auth0 handles storing and refreshing access tokens from identity providers like Google, Github, Microsoft, and more. Your applications can then seamlessly call downstream APIs—such as Google Calendar, GitHub repositories, Microsoft Word, etc.

This feature is currently only available for Public Cloud tenants. To enable the Early Access release for your Auth0 tenant, please connect with your Technical Account Manager. 

For complete setup instructions and more, refer to the [Token Vault documentation](https://auth0.com/docs/secure/tokens/token-vault).

                   <pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate>
                   <description>We&amp;apos;re super excited to announce the developer beta of Auth0 MCP Server to make tenant management conversational, intuitive, and incredibly efficient for developers. Recently, Model Context Protocol (MCP) has been growing at a rapid pace and has enabled AI agents to communicate with external tools, resources, or remote services on behalf of users.

Auth0 MCP Server lets developers interface with Auth0 using natural language instead of complex APIs or dashboard navigation, dramatically simplifying tenant management workflows. For instance, developers could simply ask Claude to create a new Auth0 app, deploy a new Action, or perform any other supported management operation.

__This initial release includes:__
- __Support for 20+ Auth0 Management operations:__ Create and manage applications, APIs, Actions, Logs, and Forms through simple, natural language conversations.
- __Secure Authentication:__ Grant tenant access to your MCP clients via a secure auth flow with built-in support for scopes and session management.
- __Multi-Step Management Workflows:__ Perform complex operations like &amp;quot;create an application with specific permissions and deploy a security Action&amp;quot; in a single conversation.
- __Seamless Integrations:__ Native support for Claude Desktop, Windsurf, Cursor, and many other MCP clients.

Get started with a simple command: `npx @auth0/auth0-mcp-server init`

                   <description>We’re excited to announce that the __Mobile Driver’s License Verification Service__ is now in __Limited Early Access__. 

Auth0’s Mobile Driver’s License (mDL) Verification Service enables customers to enrich user profiles with trusted information during signup and login flows as well as perform ad-hoc verification and validation checks. Additionally, utilizing a digital credential can streamline processes for businesses and financial institutions while allowing end-users more control over their information.

With this feature, customers can perform ad-hoc mDL verification requests or integrate them into their existing authorization flows with our Forms widget. This Early Access release only supports the [ISO/IEC TS 18013-7:2024](https://www.iso.org/standard/82772.html) standard and the REST API, also known as Web API, protocol.

To enable the Limited Early Access release in your Auth0 tenant, please review the available [documentation](https://auth0.com/docs/secure/mdl-verification) and if interested, please fill out [this](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScEZSizEo6prfnxg_8YvU3Pv0s6rwryEpjEZt_9X3vplQhXVQ/viewform) form to request access. We are limiting the number of customers for whom this will be enabled and will reach out to you with more details.

                   <description>We’ve added Domain Verification to the Self-Service SSO workflow — making it easier and more secure for your customers to manage their SSO setup.

__Simpified &amp;amp; Secure__

Your customers can now verify domains directly within the Self-Service SSO wizard, reducing manual steps and ensuring only trusted domains are used for Home Realm Discovery (HRD). This strengthens security and eliminates the need for external verification workflows.

__Flexible Configuration Options__

As a tenant admin, you have control over how domain verification is enforced when creating Self-Service SSO tickets:

- Off – Domain verification is hidden from the wizard
- Optional – Customers can choose to skip verification and still enable connections
- Required – A domain must be verified before enabling the connection

This gives you the flexibility to balance user experience and security based on your customers&amp;apos; needs.

                   <pubDate>Tue, 25 Mar 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate>
                   <description>The Auth0 Dashboard allows customers to reset the code for a Custom Provider when they click the Reset button. Previously, this experience was different across Custom Email and Phone Provider in both the behavior of the button and the text displayed throughout the reset process. This behavior has been fixed, and now the reset functionality is consistent across both features. </description>

                   <pubDate>Tue, 25 Mar 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate>
                   <description>This feature gives developers better observability regarding Actions execution errors both at the Auth0 Dashboard and external Log Stream Platforms. 

Here&amp;apos;s a summary of the key points:

- __Execution Error Handling:__ The feature captures the unhandled Actions execution errors and facilitates them as Tenant logs.
- __Event Log Type:__  There is a [new Event Log Type](https://auth0.com/docs/deploy-monitor/logs/log-event-type-codes &amp;quot;actions_execution_failed&amp;quot;) regarding Actions execution errors that can be visualized at the Dashboard &amp;gt; Monitoring &amp;gt; Logs.
- __Log Streams:__ The new event log type is also sent through Log Streams.
- __Log Stream Filter:__ There is a [new Log Stream Filter](https://auth0.com/docs/customize/log-streams/event-filters#actions-event-filters &amp;quot;Action Execution - Failure&amp;quot;) focused on Actions execution errors.</description>

                   <title>Event Streams for User Life Cycle Management -- Public Beta</title>
                   <pubDate>Tue, 25 Mar 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate>
                   <description>Auth0 Customers have historically struggled to easily discover changes to the User Lifecycle (user create, updated or deleted), by relying on suboptimal solutions such as Actions or Logs.

Event Streams changes this: customers can now subscribe to [events](https://auth0.com/docs/deploy-monitor/events/event-types#user-event-types) that trigger each time there is a change in the User Lifecycle, regardless of the connection the customer was created, and route those events to either a [Webhook](https://auth0.com/docs/deploy-monitor/events/create-an-event-stream#webhooks) or [AWS EventBridge](https://auth0.com/docs/deploy-monitor/events/create-an-event-stream#aws-eventbridge).

Auth0 is now accepting Beta Testers to this new feature.  See the [Auth0 Docs](https://auth0.com/docs/deploy-monitor/events) for further instructions.</description>

If your language preference is set to Japanese in your browser settings, Auth0 will detect this and automatically serve the Dashboard and Documentation in Japanese. You can manually override this setting in the Auth0 Dashboard and Docs via the language switcher in the top-right corner.</description>

                   <title>Custom Phone Providers and the Unified Phone Experience are now Generally Available!</title>
                   <pubDate>Thu, 13 Mar 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate>
                   <description>We’re excited to announce that __Custom Phone Providers and the Unified Phone Experience__ are now Generally Available.

__Custom Phone Providers__: With this feature, customers can configure custom phone providers and customize phone messages not only when leveraging phone number as an identifier, but also when using MFA and Passwordless! Auth0’s CI/CD tooling (Auth0 CLI, Deploy CLI, and Terraform Provider) now fully supports Custom Phone Providers. To access these new capabilities, upgrade to the latest versions of Auth0 CLI, Deploy CLI, and Terraform Provider.

We encourage you to get started with Custom Phone Providers today by checking out our [documentation](https://auth0.com/docs/customize/phone-messages/configure-phone-messaging-providers/configure-a-custom-phone-provider) and if you have any feedback, give us a shout in our [community channel](https://community.auth0.com/)!

__Unified Phone Experience__: The Unified Phone Experience offers a consolidated experience where you can configure a tenant-level phone provider that will be used for Phone as ID, MFA, and Passwordless flows. Additionally, the management of phone templates will be centralized on a single page. This unification aims to reduce redundancy across Auth0 features and present a more streamlined user experience. The unified experience will be the default for any new tenants created after this release, and existing tenants will have the ability to revert to the legacy experience if desired.

We encourage you to try out the new Unified Phone Experience and provide feedback and questions to us through our [community channel](https://community.auth0.com/). Information on how to migrate to the new experience can be found [here](https://auth0.com/docs/customize/phone-messages/unified-phone).</description>

                   <title>Breached Password Detection for Password Reset Flows is Now Available!</title>
                   <pubDate>Tue, 11 Mar 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate>
                   <description>We&amp;apos;re improving both account security and user experience by extending **Breached Password Detection** to the **password reset flow**.  

#### 🔹 What’s New?  
Previously, users could unknowingly reset their passwords to compromised credentials, creating security risks and potentially requiring another reset. 

With this update, you can now prevent users from setting their password to a known breached credential during the reset flow -just like during sign-up and login.  

Additionally, with this rollout we have also **increased coverage** of Breached Password Detection on Sign-Up to cover the **Management API**!

#### 🚀 Benefits  

**Stronger security** – Protects against compromised credentials at every stage.

 **Better user experience** – Avoids unnecessary password resets by blocking breached passwords upfront.  

This update helps prevent your users from using known compromised credentials throughout their password lifecycle, giving your users stronger security on their accounts.   

For additional details and to learn how to enable **Breach Password Detection on Password Reset Flows**, please view our online documentation [here](https://auth0.com/docs/secure/attack-protection/breached-password-detection).

                   <description>This feature allows developers to ensure their custom database scripts are compatible with specific Node.js runtime versions. 

Here&amp;apos;s a summary of the key points:

- __Bulk Testing Compatibility:__ The feature can test the compatibility of custom database scripts with different supported Node.js runtime versions.
- __Database Connections Limit:__ It is available if your tenant has 1 to 10 database connections with custom database scripts enabled.
- __Navigation Path:__ The feature can be accessed by going to Tenant Settings → Advanced → Extensibility → Verify Custom DB Scripts.

__Actions Based on Results:__ After testing, the results can be verified and corrective actions can be taken if any compatibility issues are identified.

                   <description>We have deprecated the invalidation of user sessions when performing database connection user update (PATCH - `/api/v2/users/{id}`) requests where:
* The `email` or `email_verified` attributes are set to an unchanged value;
* The `email_verified` attribute is set to a `true` value.

These changes allow for consistent behavior between setting an email as verified through the Management API and the built-in email verification flows provided by the service. In addition, it improves the overall end-user experience by avoiding session invalidation in situations that do not require it, such as setting either the `email` or `email_verified` attributes to unchanged values.

The dashboard will be updated with a migration toggle to opt out of the deprecated behavior ahead of its future end-of-life; we have provided additional information and timelines for enforcing this change through a [dashboard and support center notification](https://manage.auth0.com/#/notifications/67ab8c121f5c740896fcfd19).

                   <pubDate>Mon, 10 Feb 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate>
                   <description>__Email OTP Verification__ is now __Generally Available (GA)__, minor improvements will continue to roll out over the next __1-4 weeks__ to enhance performance and usability.

With __Email OTP Verification__, users are required to enter a One-Time Password (OTP) sent to their email during the signup or password reset process. This ensures email verification happens __before__ account creation or password reset is completed, offering enhanced security and reducing the chances of mistyped or fake email accounts.

__Key Highlights:__

- __Synchronous Email Verification:__ Prevents account creation or password reset until users verify their email via OTP.
- __Improved Security:__ Helps prevent fake accounts, ensures accurate email addresses, and discourages phishing through email links.
- __Applicability:__ Available for both email verification during signup and password reset challenges.

__Prerequisites:__

- Must be using __Universal Login__.
- Connection must have __Flexible Identifiers__ enabled.
- Email OTP is only compatible when using the __Identifier First Authentication Profile__.

To enable this feature, navigate to the __Attributes__ tab on any connection and change the __Verification Method__ under the __Email__ attribute settings from __Verification Link__ to __OTP__.</description>

                   <pubDate>Thu, 06 Feb 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate>
                   <description>We are thrilled to announce the Early Access release of Custom Token Exchange. __Enterprise customers__ can now request access to use this feature.

Token Exchange is an OAuth grant-type that enables the exchange of security tokens for other security tokens, typically access_tokens. Custom Token Exchange provides a flexible __solution using Actions that allows customers to provide their custom logic to control the exchange__ - i.e. effectively providing the means to implement custom authentication semantics using Actions.

![Custom_Token_Exchange_EA_Action](https://cdn.auth0.com/blog/Custom_Token_Exchange_EA_Changelog.png)

This __added flexibility__ can be used by customers to tackle __advanced integration use cases__, such as:
- Seamlessly migrating users to Auth0
- Integrating external IDPs

                   <title>Advanced Customizations for Universal Login (Early Access) is launching today!</title>
                   <pubDate>Thu, 06 Feb 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate>
                   <description>At Auth0, we understand that no two customer identity stories are the same.  Every company has a brand identity, a secret sauce, and a unique aesthetic vision. Today, we are very excited to introduce the next evolution in customization for Universal Login, **Advanced Customizations for Universal Login** (ACUL). ACUL enables your team to build custom, client-rendered versions of each Universal Login screen, allowing you to control every pixel of the Universal Login experience.

                   <title>Okta Universal Logout Integration Now Supported in Auth0</title>
                   <pubDate>Fri, 31 Jan 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate>
                   <description>We’re thrilled to announce that Auth0 now supports Universal Logout integration with Okta Workforce Identity Cloud!

Okta Universal Logout is based on the [Global Token Revocation](https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-parecki-oauth-global-token-revocation-04.html) specification and allows security incident management tools [Okta Identity Threat Protection](https://www.okta.com/products/identity-threat-protection/) to send back-channel requests to revoke users&amp;apos; sessions and refresh tokens when they identify a change in risk.

With this feature, Auth0 customers federating with Okta Workforce Identity using the [Okta](https://auth0.com/docs/authenticate/identity-providers/enterprise-identity-providers/okta), [SAML](https://auth0.com/docs/authenticate/identity-providers/enterprise-identity-providers/saml), or [OpenID Connect](https://auth0.com/docs/authenticate/identity-providers/enterprise-identity-providers/oidc) connection types no longer need to build a global token revocation endpoint. Instead, with minimal configuration required, they can provide the Okta admin with Auth0’s connection-specific endpoint URL.

This integration provides security benefits for apps that depend on refresh tokens and Auth0 sessions, as both are revoked when Auth0 receives a Universal Logout request for a user. This integration can also trigger Auth0&amp;apos;s OIDC back-channel logout feature to terminate custom application sessions.

To learn more about Universal Logout support in Auth0, click [here](https://auth0.com/docs/authenticate/login/logout/universal-logout).

This feature will be rolled out to all public cloud environments over the next few days and to private cloud environments as per their release pipeline.

                   <title>New Access Controls for Okta FGA Using Per-Module Authorization</title>
                   <pubDate>Fri, 31 Jan 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate>
                   <description>We are excited to introduce the Per-Module Authorization feature. This enables large organizations to securely share authorization models by specifying which application credentials can update data for specific modules.

Teams that are responsible for their own separate services can now limit access to modification of authorization data on a per-module basis. Last year, we released [Modular Models](https://docs.fga.dev/modeling/modular-models), where a single model could be separated into modules across multiple files, allowing teams to use features in their source code management platforms (such as GitHub’s [CODEOWNERS](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-code-owners) feature) to enforce access on who can modify parts of a model.

Per-Module Authorization builds on top of that work to further define permissions for applications. Workflows can be implemented where different teams maintain their portion of an FGA model independently and also ensure that the services and applications owned by the respective teams can only modify their own authorization data.

For more details, refer to Okta FGA’s [documentation](https://docs.fga.dev/intro/dashboard#grant-authorized-clients-access-to-write-specific-modules) on how to grant client credentials access to only specific modules.

                   <title>Introducing Next.js SDK v4 (GA)</title>
                   <pubDate>Thu, 30 Jan 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate>
                   <description>We are excited to announce the next major version of Next.js SDK. With the introduction of [nextjs-auth0 v4](https://github.com/auth0/nextjs-auth0), we now support Next.js 15 and React 19, allowing developers to leverage the latest features and improvements in both frameworks. 
This compatibility not only enhances the development experience but also ensures that applications can take full advantage of performance optimizations. This updated SDK features a simplified architecture and is edge-compatible by default, enhancing performance and flexibility for developers. 

What’s new: 
- __Middleware-Based Authentication:__ Improved compatibility and reduced maintenance by moving to middleware-based handlers.
- __Enhanced Security:__ Switched to encrypted cookies and removed outdated cookie logic.
- __Resolved State Mismatch Issues:__ Fixed long-standing issues reported by the community.
- __Improved Session Management:__ Implemented rolling sessions and eliminated cookie chunking.
- __Improved Hooks and Helpers:__ Introduced useUser(), getAccessToken(), and getSession() for easier data fetching and session handling.
- __Stateful Sessions with Custom Databases:__ Support for &amp;quot;Bring Your Own Database&amp;quot; (BYODB).
- Compatibility with __Next.js 15__, __Turbopack__, and __React 19__
- __Simplified architecture__, API, and configuration options

                   <title>Update to Default From Email Address for Supported Email Providers!</title>
                   <pubDate>Tue, 28 Jan 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate>
                   <description>__What’s Changing:__
We are improving the Dashboard configuration experience for email providers. The default From address field will be required when creating or updating email provider configuration through the Dashboard. Customers do not need to take immediate action, and the Management API will maintain the field as optional for backward compatibility.

__Key Dashboard Updates:__

1. __Configuring New Email Providers__: Customers must supply a default From address when configuring a new email provider.
2. __Changing Existing Email Providers__: Customers must supply a default From address when updating an existing email provider. Existing configured email providers that do not have a From address configured will continue to work as before.

__Why This Matters__: An email provider configured without a default From address may lead to a poor user experience because email template customizations are not supported when a customer-defined From address is unavailable. By requiring a default From address at the email provider level, email template customizations will be respected even if the email template does not have a template-specific From address.

__Rollout Timing__: We plan to roll out this change in the coming days. After the rollout, customers can expect to see the enforcement of this required field on the Dashboard.</description>

                   <title>Custom Email Providers is now Generally Available!</title>
                   <pubDate>Thu, 23 Jan 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate>
                   <description>We’re excited to announce that __Custom Email Providers__ is now __Generally Available__.

With this feature, customers can configure custom email providers and customize emails so they can have full control of the email delivery process. This feature utilizes the Actions framework and leverages the Actions Code Editor so you can more completely manage, monitor, and troubleshoot your email communications. Auth0’s CI/CD tooling (Auth0 CLI, Deploy CLI, and Terraform Provider) now fully supports Custom Email Providers. To access these new capabilities, upgrade to the latest versions of Auth0 CLI, Deploy CLI, and Terraform Provider.

We encourage you to get started with Custom Email Providers today by checking out our [documentation](https://auth0.com/docs/customize/email/configure-a-custom-email-provider) and if you have any feedback, give us a shout in our [community channel](https://community.auth0.com/)!</description>

                   <title>Actions - Real-time Logs (Beta)</title>
                   <pubDate>Tue, 21 Jan 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate>
                   <description>This Beta feature logs in real-time output form your custom Actions code. This includes all console.log output and exceptions.

For example, a custom Action code such as below:

    console.log(&amp;quot;Hello world!&amp;quot;);

Will show up within Dashboard &amp;gt; Monitoring &amp;gt; Actions Logs as

![Actions Real Time logs](//images.ctfassets.net/kbkgmx9upatd/6v7b2XDiOVFXJa1haVksyR/96d19473a46441c432e6997d5594a06f/Screenshot_2025-01-20_at_5.19.02_PM.png)

You can also use examples such as below to catch and log errors for making it easy to debug and troubleshoot your Actions.

    try {
      nonExistentFunction();
    } catch (error) {
      console.error(error);
      // Expected output: ReferenceError: nonExistentFunction is not defined
      // (Note: the exact output may be browser-dependent)
    }

These logs are not stored and are only available within the dashboard when you are logged in and are on the Dashboard &amp;gt; Monitoring &amp;gt; Actions Logs tab within the browser. These logs are designed to help you troubleshoot as you write or modify your custom Actions code.</description>

                   <description>Node.js 22 is now generally available (GA) as a runtime for your extensibility integrations (such as Actions, Rules, Hooks, Custom Database Connections etc).

New Actions created will now default to Node 22 as the runtime. As part of this release, we have also split runtime selection for Legacy Extensibility (for Rules &amp;amp; Hooks) separate from the general Extensibility (for Custom Database Scripts &amp;amp; Custom Social Connections). These setting are available within [Tenant &amp;gt; Settings &amp;gt; Advanced](https://manage.auth0.com/#/tenant/advanced) and allows you to individually manage desired runtime configuration as required.

                   <pubDate>Wed, 08 Jan 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate>
                   <description>We are delighted to announce that support for the Client-Initiated Backchannel Authentication (CIBA) flow is now available in Early Access. 

The CIBA flow works as a *decoupled authentication flow* across two different devices: 
- Consumption device: initiates the authentication request.
- Authentication device: handles end-user authentication, implemented as a custom mobile app which embeds the Guardian mobile SDK.

The CIBA flow supports a number of powerful use cases driven by backend client applications, such as: 

- Customer authentication by headless devices or devices with limited interaction capabilities. 
- Customer authentication in call centre scenarios.
- Authorising sensitive operations on behalf of yourself or a third-party e.g. a customer service agent.  

To evaluate CIBA for securing your sensitive customer interactions, contact your Technical Account Manager.

With Control Your Own Key, you can manage the lifecycle of the Tenant Master Key according to your security policy. Bring Your Own Key allows you to maintain ownership of the Root Key that protects the encryption key hierarchy. These features enable compliance with cryptographic key-related security policies for data protection.

                   <description>We added a new API command available in the Password Reset / PostChallenge trigger.  This API allows Tenant Developers to specify the url to redirect a user to upon the completion of a password reset on Universal Login.  

Here is an example of using the command to redirect the user to a sample url after a successful password reset: 

      exports.onExecutePostChallenge = async (event, api) =&amp;gt; {
        api.transaction.setResultUrl(&amp;apos;https://yourapp.yourdomain.com/profile&amp;apos;);

                   <pubDate>Mon, 18 Nov 2024 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate>
                   <description>We have transitioned the Rules and Hooks features to a read-only mode in all public cloud environments as part of their [announced deprecation](https://auth0.com/docs/troubleshoot/product-lifecycle/deprecations-and-migrations#rules-and-hooks-deprecations) plan.

You can still disable, delete or re-enable an existing Rule or Hook. You can also add or remove Rules settings (for updating stored secrets) or Hook secrets but you will no longer be able to modify their script.

If this impacts you, our recommendation is to migrate to Actions. Refer to the following docs for more details:
- [Migrate Rules to Actions](https://auth0.com/docs/customize/actions/migrate/migrate-from-rules-to-actions)

                   <description>Hello everyone,

We&amp;apos;re thrilled to announce the beta release of nextjs-auth0 SDK v4! This new version brings significant improvements, new features, and fixes to enhance your development experience.

### Important Notice About v3
As we move forward, **we will not be updating v3 of the SDK to support Next.js 15**. This allows us to focus on v4, which offers a wealth of new features and improvements.

v3 will continue to receive critical security updates for 6 months after the GA of v4.

### Highlights of v4 Beta
- Middleware-Based Authentication: Improved compatibility and reduced maintenance by moving to middleware-based handlers.
- Enhanced Security: Switched to encrypted cookies and removed outdated cookie logic.
- Resolved State Mismatch Issues: Fixed long-standing issues reported by the community.
- Improved Session Management: Implemented rolling sessions and eliminated cookie chunking.
- Improved Hooks and Helpers: Introduced useUser(), getAccessToken(), and getSession() for easier data fetching and session handling.
- Stateful Sessions with Custom Databases: Support for &amp;quot;Bring Your Own Database&amp;quot; (BYODB).
- Compatibility with Next.js 15, Turbopack, and React 19
- Simplified architecture, API, and configuration options

### Try It Out and Provide Feedback
We invite you to explore the beta release and share your feedback to help us improve before the general availability release. We are currently targeting a general availability release by the end of December.

**Beta Release:**[ v4.0.0-beta.3](https://github.com/auth0/nextjs-auth0/releases/tag/v4.0.0-beta.3)

### Need Help with Migration?
If you encounter challenges migrating to v4, please don&amp;apos;t hesitate to[ open an issue](https://github.com/auth0/nextjs-auth0/issues) and our team will assist you. We&amp;apos;re committed to making the transition as smooth as possible.

Thank You for Your Support

                   <title>Self-Service SSO: Exciting Updates</title>
                   <pubDate>Thu, 14 Nov 2024 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate>
                   <description>Auth0 is excited to announce the following updates to Self-Service SSO:

1. __Custom Introduction Text:__ You can now customize the welcome message on the wizard&amp;apos;s landing screen, aligning the experience with your brand’s tone and engaging users right from the start.
2. __PingFederate Support:__ We&amp;apos;ve expanded our list of supported Identity Providers (IdPs) to include PingFederate, giving you more flexibility in your authentication options.
3. __Revoking SSO Access Tickets:__ Our [new API endpoint](https://auth0.com/docs/api/management/v2/self-service-profiles/post-revoke) lets you revoke SSO access tickets at any time.
4. __Updated Ticket Expiration:__ Access tickets are now consumed only when a connection is created, enabled or edited — like when updating SAML or OIDC details — avoiding issues with scanners opening them prematurely.
5. __Customized Login Experience:__ When creating a [ticket](https://auth0.com/docs/api/management/v2/self-service-profiles/post-sso-ticket), you can now define the login experience — adding optional parameters for Home Realm Discovery, Organization Auto-Membership, and more to tailor every step of the way.

                   <description>The possibility to __scope machine-to-machine access to a specific organization is now Generally Available__.

You can easily __define and enforce access to one, many, or all the organizations in your tenant and securely expand the reach of your SaaS APIs__ to more use cases and scenarios, making sure sensitive data and operations are only accessible to authorized parties. After configuring the access rights for your API, you simply have to inspect the `org_id` in access tokens of incoming requests, independently of whether they come from third-party applications or your own applications.

This feature is available for B2B Professional, Enterprise and Enterprise Premium customers.

                   <pubDate>Fri, 25 Oct 2024 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate>
                   <description>Auth0 is delighted to launch __Private Performance Burst AWS - 30x (3000 RPS*) and 60x (6000 RPS)__ offerings for Private Cloud deployments on AWS.

These cost-effective Private Performance options scale the Authentication traffic up to 3000 RPS and 6000 RPS respectively for 80 hours a month, and allow usage up to 1500 RPS and 3000 RPS respectively for the remaining duration. 

The elevated transaction capacity comes handy for planned and unplanned traffic spikes, e.g. during product launches, large media events, seasonal activities, and unpredictable usage peaks. 

The Private Performance Burst offering is just another milestone in our commitment to providing the functionality and flexibility our beloved customers need. 

Please refer to [Private Performance Burst documentation page](https://auth0.com/docs/troubleshoot/customer-support/operational-policies/rate-limit-policy#private-performance-burst) for more information.

                   <pubDate>Wed, 23 Oct 2024 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate>
                   <description>The [Okta FGA](https://fga.dev) authorization modeling language allows defining conditions that can be used to express certain ABAC authorization policies. Previously, if you wanted to take advantage of that feature you needed to use the [Okta FGA API](https://docs.fga.dev/api/service) or the [FGA CLI](https://docs.fga.dev/getting-started/cli).

Now, with the [Okta Fine Grained Authorization Dashboard](https://dashboard.fga.dev &amp;quot;Okta FGA Dashboard&amp;quot;), you can create conditional relationship tuples and specify context parameters in assertions, making it easier to fully define ABAC-like conditions directly within the dashboard.

For more details, refer to the  [Okta FGA dashboard documentation](https://docs.fga.dev/intro/dashboard#conditions).

                   <title>Update to Session Termination Behavior when Adding Identifiers</title>
                   <pubDate>Fri, 27 Sep 2024 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate>
                   <description>**What’s Changing:**

We are improving the user experience when adding or updating identifiers (email, phone number, or username) in profiles.

**Key Updates:**

1. **New Identifier**: When a new identifier type (email, phone, or username) is added to a user profile where one **does not already exist**, the user’s session **will not be terminated**. This allows for a smoother **progressive profiling** experience, where users can add new identifiers without disruption.  
2. **Changing Existing Identifier**: When an existing identifier is modified, the user’s session **will terminate**, and the user will have to re-authenticate. This ensures security best practices are followed when updating key account information.

**Why This Matters:** Previously, any update to an identifier (whether adding or changing it) would terminate the user’s session. This could lead to a poor experience, especially during progressive profiling, where users are expected to update or add information without being logged out. With this update, customers can offer a seamless experience for users adding new identifiers while maintaining strict security for changes to existing identifiers.

**Rollout Timing:** This change will be rolled out progressively over the next 1-4 weeks. Customers can expect to see the updated session handling behavior in their environments during this period.

**Action Required:** No immediate action is required from customers, but it is recommended to review any user flows that involve the addition or modification of identifiers to ensure they align with this change.</description>

                   <title>Email OTP Verification (Early Access)</title>
                   <pubDate>Fri, 27 Sep 2024 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate>
                   <description>We have introduced __Email OTP Verification__ as a new method for email verification, available in Early Access. Expect to see the feature in your environments within the next 1-4 weeks.

With __Email OTP Verification__, users are required to enter a One-Time Password (OTP) sent to their email during the signup or password reset process. This ensures email verification happens __before__ account creation or password reset is completed, offering enhanced security and reducing the chances of mistyped or fake email accounts.

__Key Highlights:__

- __Synchronous Email Verification:__ Prevents account creation or password reset until users verify their email via OTP.
- __Improved Security:__ Helps prevent fake accounts, ensures accurate email addresses, and discourages phishing through email links.
- __Applicability:__ Available for both email verification during signup and password reset challenges.

__Prerequisites:__

- Must be using __Universal Login__.
- Connection must have __Flexible Identifiers__ enabled.
- Email OTP is only compatible when using the __Identifier First Authentication Profile__.

To enable this feature, navigate to the __Attributes__ tab on any connection and change the __Verification Method__ under the __Email__ attribute settings from __Verification Link__ to __OTP__.

                   <pubDate>Wed, 25 Sep 2024 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate>
                   <description>We are happy to announce that we just added two new endpoints to our Session Management APIs:

[POST  /api/v2/users/{id}/revoke-access](https://auth0.com/docs/api/management/v2/users/user-revoke-access) – This endpoint allows you to revoke sessions for a user and decide if you want to revoke the associated Refresh Tokens.

[POST  /api/v2/sessions/{id}/revoke](https://auth0.com/docs/api/management/v2/sessions/revoke-session) – This endpoint will revoke the session and all its related Refresh Tokens.

Please refer to the [Auth0 Management API](https://auth0.com/docs/api/management/v2/introduction) for more information.

                   <description>Auth0 Actions dashboard experience &amp;amp; documentation has been updated to consolidate around the concept of &amp;quot;Triggers&amp;quot; (as opposed to our previous mix of Flows and Triggers). A trigger represent points in the Auth0 process where Actions can be added.

We believe this change will make it easier for you to identify available customization options (now simply labelled as [triggers](https://auth0.com/docs/customize/actions/explore-triggers)) and how they can be leveraged to personalize your identity needs.

                   <title>Continuous Session Protection now available for enterprise customers </title>
                   <pubDate>Tue, 24 Sep 2024 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate>
                   <description>Continuous Session Protection is now generally available for enterprise customers, providing powerful tools to dynamically manage Sessions and Refresh Tokens within Auth0 Actions. This feature offers flexible options to configure expiration settings, access additional session and token data, and revoke sessions when necessary, enhancing security and control.

Key benefits of Continuous Session Protection include:

- Dynamic Session and Token Expiration: Configure custom absolute and idle timeouts for Sessions and Refresh Tokens using the new setExpiresAt(Date) and setIdleExpiresAt(Date) methods. These settings can be applied across users, organizations, or specific connections to meet your security and compliance needs.
- Enhanced Security with Revocation: Revoke Sessions and Refresh Tokens programmatically using Actions, based on custom logic or risk assessments. This allows you to take immediate action when suspicious behavior is detected or when tokens no longer meet your security policies.
- Comprehensive Session and Token Insights: Access additional session and refresh token attributes within Actions, enabling you to make more informed, data-driven decisions for managing user sessions.
- These features allow enterprise customers to dynamically improve their security posture by customizing session behavior, enforcing shorter expiration times for high-risk roles (such as administrators), and revoking tokens when necessary to mitigate risks.

                   <description>**Passwordless Connection Support**

Universal Login now supports customizing the passwordless signup and login authentication flows, allowing customers to address their unique data capture, security, and compliance requirements when users authenticate with email and SMS one-time passwords. 

See our [online documentation](https://auth0.com/docs/customize/login-pages/universal-login/customize-signup-and-login-prompts) for more information, instructions and examples.

**Dev Tooling support for the Partials API**

Auth0’s CI/CD tooling (Auth0 CLI, Deploy CLI, Terraform Provider) now fully supports the Partial API including the new Passwordless prompts. As a bonus, Partials can now also be edited using Auth0 CLI’s UL Customize interface. Run `auth0 ul customize` in your terminal to see it in action. To access these new capabilities, upgrade to the latest versions of Auth0 CLI, Deploy CLI, and Terraform Provider.

                   <title>Private Cloud for Okta FGA is now Generally Available</title>
                   <pubDate>Fri, 30 Aug 2024 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate>
                   <description>Okta FGA has now two deployment options: public cloud and private cloud. The public cloud option is a multi-tenant SaaS service available in three geographies: the United States, Europe, and Australia, offering a highly available multi-region deployment. The private cloud option, on the other hand, is tailored for enterprises seeking dedicated resources. Okta FGA Private Cloud leverages the same architecture principles that have been battle-tested with Auth0 for over two years.

Private Cloud for Okta FGA has the following benefits:

- Higher RPS: Private cloud instances are optimized for high request-per-second (RPS) performance, scaling up to five times the average RPS based on your application’s needs. 
- High Availability: Okta FGA for Private Cloud is always deployed in two AWS regions with active-active data replication, minimizing the chances of being impacted by an AWS region outage.
- Data Residency and Compliance: Deploy your Private Cloud environment in any AWS region to meet specific data residency and compliance requirements. Initial regions include the US, Germany, Ireland, UK, France, Japan, India, Singapore, Australia, and Brazil.
- Reduced Latency: Choose the AWS region closest to your application servers, which will significantly reduce latency for faster access control checks.
- Multi-Geography Deployments: Businesses can replicate the same authorization data across multiple regions worldwide, allowing them to maintain low-latency authorization services even for globally distributed applications. For example, a company can have the same data in the US, EU, and Australia, have their authorization data replicated across all regions, and have their applications routed to the closest region.
- Automated, Hardened Release: Benefit from automated weekly releases that are previously validated in Okta’s public cloud deployments.
- Centralized Management: Customers can manage both private and public cloud instances seamlessly from the Okta FGA dashboard.

                   <description>We are pleased to announce that developers using Okta FGA now have a way to specify their required consistency level when querying Okta FGA.

To minimize latency, Okta FGA uses two levels of caching that can result on permissions changes not being reflected in authorization queries for up to 20 seconds. 

All query APIs (Check, Read, ListObjects, ListUsers, Expand) now have an additional optional parameter with two possible values:

- __MINIMIZE_LATENCY__ (default): Okta FGA will try to minimize latency (e.g. by making use of the cache)
- __HIGHER_CONSISTENCY__: Okta FGA  will try to optimize for stronger consistency (e.g. by bypassing cache)

When using HIGHER_CONSISTENCY, latency will be higher as Okta FGA will ready directly from the database. Developers need to make the trade off between consistency and latency depending on the use case.

All SDKs were updated with support for the new parameter.

You can learn more in the [Okta FGA documentation](http://docs.fga.dev/writing-data/consistency-modes).</description>

                   <description>__[Prioritized Log Streams](https://auth0.com/docs/secure/security-center/prioritized-log-streams)__ is now Generally Available (GA) 

Now, Enterprise customers can stream a predefined set of security risk-related log events through a dedicated architecture with higher confidence. Customers can stream events to SIEM tools, monitor, and take action on Security events without interruption when there is an attack on the customer’s tenant or abnormally high user activity.

The feature is available in all Public cloud environments and rolling out to Private spaces throughout the next few weeks.

                   <description>Following on the objective to improve the capabilities to dynamically manage Sessions and Refresh Tokens, we are happy to announce that we have added new methods to control the expiration of Sessions and Refresh Tokens using Actions.

Now you can control the absolute and inactivity timeouts with the new `setExpiresAt(Date)` and `setIdleExpireAt(Date)` methods, available for post-login Action objects `api.session` and `api.refresh_token`.

They can be used in different use cases, for example, you can improve your security posture by enforcing shorter expiration times for administrators, specific Connections or Organizations.

To learn more, read our public docs: [Sessions with Actions](https://auth0.com/docs/manage-users/sessions/manage-sessions-actions) and [Refresh Tokens with Actions](https://auth0.com/docs/secure/tokens/refresh-tokens/manage-refresh-tokens-actions).

They are now available in Private Early Access. If you are an Enterprise customer, please reach out to your Technical Account Manager (TAM) to request access.

                   <pubDate>Mon, 12 Aug 2024 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate>
                   <description>Have you ever wondered, as a user of the Auth0 platform, how many active sessions you have for the different Auth0 dashboard applications across your multiple devices?
Introducing Auth0 Dashboard Login Session Management, allowing Auth0 Dashboard admins to not only view all active dashboard sessions but also the ability to revoke them. This beta feature provides an added layer of security to session idle timeout for our Public Cloud customers.

                   <title>Support Access Role Deprecation: Access to the &amp;quot;Subscription Tickets&amp;quot; Feature in Support Center now requires the new &amp;quot;Elevated Support Access&amp;quot; Role</title>
                   <pubDate>Thu, 08 Aug 2024 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate>
                   <description>#### What has changed?
We have deprecated the &amp;quot;Support Access&amp;quot; Role so that the only tenant member role that now has access to the [“Subscription Tickets”](https://auth0.com/docs/troubleshoot/customer-support/open-and-manage-support-tickets#manage-subscription-tickets-) feature within the Auth0 Support Center are those with the new [Elevated Support Access role](https://auth0.com/docs/get-started/manage-dashboard-access/feature-access-by-role) within the [Role Based Access Control (RBAC)](https://auth0.com/docs/get-started/manage-dashboard-access/add-dashboard-users) feature in the Auth0 Management Dashboard. The Subscription Tickets feature in [Support Center](https://support.auth0.com/) allows access to view and manage **all tickets created by all users across a tenant. The current ‘Support Access’ role is now deprecated.**

Tenant Administrators do not automatically inherit the new ‘Elevated Support Access’ role and will need to explicitly add themselves to the role via the Auth0 Management Dashboard to continue to have access to view and manage all tickets across their tenant(s) via the Subscription Tickets feature. **Tenant Administrators and all tenant members will still have access to the Auth0 Support Center to create and manage *their own tickets* without adding any additional roles.** 

#### Why did we make this change?
In order to increase the security of the Auth0 Support Center, the ‘Subscription Tickets’ feature will be tied specifically to the new **Elevated Support Access** role so that access is not automatically inherited by all Tenant Admin users. This prevents roles from being able to see tickets they did not create without explicitly granting them access to do so. 

#### How are you affected?
Tenant Administrators no longer have access to view and manage **all tickets** for your tenant on the ‘Subscription Tickets’ page in the Auth0 Support Center __unless__ the Elevated Support Access role is added to their user. **You will still be able to access the Auth0 Support Center and create &amp;amp; manage the support tickets you created.**

#### What action do you need to take?
If you have a paid subscription, you can add yourself and any other users who need to see/manage all tickets (even those they did not create) across the tenant to the new **Elevated Support Access** role from the Auth0 Management Dashboard. __You should also review who__ __currently has the legacy ‘Support Access’ role assigned and determine if they should be removed and/or added to have the new Elevated Support Access role.__

If you are currently on a Free plan, there is no action required and this communication is to inform you that you will only be able to view and manage support tickets that you created.

#### How can you get additional assistance?

                   <pubDate>Fri, 02 Aug 2024 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate>
                   <description>The Log Stream filters have been updated with a new filter category. This category complements the [SCIM GA announcement](https://auth0.com/changelog#3iRVwR6TAFeSJhqIYwIWK2) and streams out only SCIM tenant logs when SCIM is enabled on the tenant. Through this capability, customers can monitor the full details of all the SCIM requests that Auth0 receives and get notified when a user is created, updated, or deleted using SCIM.

This feature is immediately available in the public cloud and will be rolled out to private cloud environments in the next few weeks as per the release pipeline.

                   <description>Deleting a Team Member from the Teams dashboard removes access to Teams and now deletes the team member from all team tenants they are a member of.
However, if you just want to remove access to one or more tenants, you can now do so from the Team Member&amp;apos;s details page.

Note: Tenant Member Management feature is required. This feature is on by default for all Self Service customers but is configurable for Public Cloud customers and is coming soon for Private Cloud customers.

Please refer to the following documentation for more information.
1. [How do you delete a Team Member from a Team and remove access to all tenants?](https://auth0.com/docs/get-started/auth0-teams/team-member-management#delete-an-existing-team-member &amp;quot;Delete a Team Member&amp;quot;)
2. [How do you delete a Team Member from one or more tenants?](https://auth0.com/docs/get-started/auth0-teams/tenant-member-management#delete-tenants-membership-with-tenant-member-management &amp;quot;Revoke Tenant Access from Teams.&amp;quot;)
3. [I am a Public Cloud Customer; how do I verify that I have the suitable feature turned on to support tenant member management?](https://auth0.com/docs/get-started/auth0-teams/tenant-member-management#turn-on-tenant-member-management &amp;quot;Turning on Tenant Member Management.&amp;quot;)

                   <description>We are excited to announce that our fourth-generation Bot Detection is now enhanced with ASN reputation signals and untrusted IP data. This upgrade integrates ASN and related IP reputation data into our proprietary Bot Detection ML model, specifically targeting scripted attacks where attackers frequently change their IP addresses. This enhancement further improves our ability to detect and thwart bot activities, thereby strengthening protection against malicious traffic.

This security feature is available to all our Enterprise customers with the Attack Protection add-on. We are currently rolling out this enhancement and expect to complete the process within the next few weeks, aligned with your individual release schedules.

To activate Bot Detection or if you require more detailed information, please visit our [online documentation](https://auth0.com/docs/secure/attack-protection/bot-detection) or contact your account team. We are here to assist you in ensuring your systems are secure against sophisticated threats.

                   <title>Flexible Identifiers Now in General Availability (GA)</title>
                   <pubDate>Wed, 24 Jul 2024 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate>
                   <description>We are excited to announce that the Flexible Identifiers feature has transitioned to General Availability (GA). This update brings several key enhancements and improvements:

**Key Updates:**

- **Better Compatibility with Organizations:** We have improved the signup experience, particularly for users joining organizations via invitation links. The signup flow now collects the password after verifying the phone number, ensuring a smoother and more secure process.
- **Username as Sole Identifier Improvements:** You can now allow self-service password reset with Username as the Sole Identifier, in order for this to work the end-user must have a valid email address on their account to receive a password reset email.
- **Overall Increased Stability:** Comprehensive testing and refinements have enhanced the reliability and performance of the Flexible Identifiers feature, ensuring a smooth and dependable user experience.

**Action Required:**

- Conduct thorough testing in a development environment before [activating Flexible Identifiers](https://auth0.com/docs/authenticate/database-connections/activate-and-configure-attributes-for-flexible-identifiers) in your live environment.
- Review the [Limitations Page](https://auth0.com/docs/authenticate/database-connections/flexible-identifiers-and-attributes) in our documentation for detailed information on feature constraints.

This rollout will be completed over the next 1-4 weeks. We encourage you to explore these new capabilities and enhance your authentication processes.</description>

                   <title>User ID Attribute Mapper for Microsoft Azure AD Connections</title>
                   <pubDate>Thu, 18 Jul 2024 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate>
                   <description>A new User ID Attribute Type menu has been added to the [Microsoft Azure AD connection](https://auth0.com/docs/authenticate/identity-providers/enterprise-identity-providers/azure-active-directory/v2) type, which allows developers to select which Azure AD user attribute is mapped to the Auth0 user_id attribute. The options correspond to the two supported ID types (sub and oid) described in [Microsoft’s ID token claims reference](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity-platform/id-token-claims-reference#use-claims-to-reliably-identify-a-user).

Whereas the Azure AD connection previously only supported the pairwise subject claim (sub), developers can now alternately choose the user object identifier claim (oid) which contains Azure AD’s immutable identifier for the user. When this option is selected, Auth0 writes the user_id value in the following format: waad|{connection-name}|{oid-value}

The &amp;quot;oid&amp;quot; option is recommended for all new single-tenant Azure AD integrations. It is also required to achieve full user lifecycle management using Auth0’s [Inbound SCIM](https://auth0.com/docs/authenticate/protocols/scim/configure-inbound-scim) feature with Azure AD. </description>

This includes integrations with Okta Workforce Identity Cloud, Microsoft Entra ID, and other Enterprise identity providers that use SAML or OpenID Connect for user authentication.

Developers can follow our configuration guide to see SCIM working in minutes. You can discover more by reading our documentation at [Configure Inbound SCIM](https://auth0.com/docs/authenticate/protocols/scim/configure-inbound-scim).

This feature is immediately available in the public cloud and will be rolled out to private cloud environments in the next few weeks as per the release pipeline.

                   <description>Auth0 is happy to announce that we have released improved capabilities to manage sessions and refresh_tokens in Actions.

Now you can get detailed information on both using event.session and event.refresh_token. Additionally, you can revoke them by using api.session.revoke() and api.refreshToken.revoke() methods.

These are powerful building blocks that can help you dynamically manage access for a wide variety of use cases, for example, you can improve your security posture by revoking sessions based on risk assessments.

These capabilities are now available in Private Early Access. If you are an Enterprise customer, please reach out to your Auth0 account contact to request access. Your account contact will provide documentation if you are approved for the Private Early Access program.

As a reminder, Machine to Machine tokens issued for Auth0 Management API are not counted against your Auth0 Subscription Machine to Machine quota limit.

Majority of our users will not see any difference in their usage data while a small number of users will see slightly lower usage from before depending on how they had defined their own custom APIs.

                   <description>Auth0 is thrilled to announce the General Availability of our latest __Public Cloud environment in Canada__. 🇨🇦🎉

The Public Cloud in Canada is our sixth Public Cloud region (besides US, EU, Japan, Australia, and UK) offering feature-rich, highly secure, resilient, and economical Auth0 solution in a multi-subscriber deployment. 

This new region enables customers in Canada to utilize our starter Essentials, Professional, and Enterprise tiers while benefiting from lower latencies and meeting data-residency requirements.

Customers may choose this Public Cloud region during the tenant creation process. The newly created Auth0 tenant will have &amp;quot;tenant&amp;quot;.ca.auth0.com domain name.

                   <title>New Private Cloud Regions in Hong Kong and Canada</title>
                   <pubDate>Tue, 18 Jun 2024 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate>
                   <description>
Auth0 is delighted to introduce two new AWS regions for Private Cloud deployments - Hong Kong and Calgary, Canada. This expansion clearly demonstrates our unwavering commitment to meet customers&amp;apos; needs for geographical availability, data residency, and resilience. 

__Hong Kong Region__: APAC is home to economies with a burgeoning demand for services. The Private Cloud (AWS) region in Hong Kong further enhances our existing extensive presence in APAC, which includes Private Cloud regions in Australia, India, Indonesia, Japan, Singapore, and South Korea as well as Public Cloud regions in Australia and Japan.

__Calgary Region__: The Private Cloud (AWS) region in Calgary joins the Montreal AWS region to serve our Canadian customers better. This region offers the following deployment options:
- __Primary region__ for new Private Cloud (AWS) deployments in Canada
- __Failover region__ for Private Cloud (AWS) GeoHA deployments (e.g. with Montreal AWS region as the primary region, enabling a full GeoHA deployment within Canada)</description>

                   <title>Refresh Tokens Management API is Now Generally Available</title>
                   <pubDate>Mon, 17 Jun 2024 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate>
                   <description>We are pleased to announce __General Availability__ of our __Refresh Tokens Management API__ to all our customers with an Enterprise plan.

Refresh Tokens API endpoints extend your session management capabilities with access to your user&amp;apos;s refresh tokens properties and administrative bulk or individual revocation endpoints. That is specially important for out-of-band session management in applications that do not rely solely on browser cookies. 

You can learn more in our [product documentation](https://auth0.com/docs/secure/tokens/manage-refresh-tokens-with-auth0-management-api) and [management API](https://auth0.com/docs/api/management/v2) for details.

                   <title>Signup with Organization Membership for Database Connections</title>
                   <pubDate>Fri, 14 Jun 2024 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate>
                   <description>Today we released support to choose whether self-service Organization signup is supported for Database connections. 

You can now navigate to Organizations -&amp;gt; “Your Organization” -&amp;gt; “Your Connection” and then select whether you want that database connection to support Organization Signup. 

Note, this new setting will outweigh the Application level setting for the Database connection. Meaning, you can disable signup support at the Application level, but enable it within the Organization, preventing the signup if an Organization is not present. 

Additionally, passwordless connections will now support Organization Membership if the Application level has signups enabled and the organization supports just-in-time membership. 

To learn more, check out the [documentation](https://auth0.com/docs/manage-users/organizations/configure-organizations/enable-connections).

                   <description>We have implemented dynamic switching between a select dropdown and an input field in the user creation modal of the Delegated Admin Extension based on the number of connections per tenant.

For tenants with over 20,000 connections:

- Instead of listing all connections in a select dropdown, a text input field is now displayed where the connection name can be manually typed.

For tenants with 20,000 or fewer connections:

- No change. A select dropdown is displayed, listing all available connections.

                   <pubDate>Tue, 11 Jun 2024 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate>
                   <description>We’ve made the migration from Rules to Actions easier for you! You can leverage the newly launched Actions migration tooling to transition from Rules to Actions leveraging QuickFix to covert Rules’ code to Actions syntax.

In most cases, you can simultaneously compare and review code between Rules and Actions, and quickly rewrite into a new Action. We also allow control of the execution sequence of old Rules and new Actions.

You can read more about this in our [product documentation](https://auth0.com/docs/customize/actions/migrate/migrate-a-rule-to-an-action).

                   <title>Access to the Subscription Tickets feature in the Auth0 Support Center is Changing on August 5, 2024</title>
                   <pubDate>Fri, 07 Jun 2024 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate>
                   <description>
# What is changing?
Starting on **August 5, 2024**, the only tenant member role that will have access to the [“Subscription Tickets”](https://auth0.com/docs/troubleshoot/customer-support/open-and-manage-support-tickets#manage-subscription-tickets-) feature within the Auth0 Support Center will be those with the new [Elevated Support Access role](https://auth0.com/docs/get-started/manage-dashboard-access/feature-access-by-role) within the [Role Based Access Control (RBAC)](https://auth0.com/docs/get-started/manage-dashboard-access/add-dashboard-users) feature in the Auth0 Management Dashboard. The Subscription Tickets feature in [Support Center](https://support.auth0.com/) allows access to view and manage **all tickets created by all users across a tenant. The current ‘Support Access’ role will be deprecated.**

Tenant Administrators will not automatically inherit the new ‘Elevated Support Access’ role and will need to explicitly add themselves to the role via the Auth0 Management Dashboard to continue to have access to view and manage all tickets across their tenant(s) via the Subscription Tickets feature. **Tenant Administrators and all tenant members will still have access to the Auth0 Support Center to create and manage *their own tickets* without adding any additional roles.** 

#### Why are we making this change?
In order to increase the security of the Auth0 Support Center, the ‘Subscription Tickets’ feature will be tied specifically to the new **Elevated Support Access** role so that access is not automatically inherited by all Tenant Admin users. This prevents roles from being able to see tickets they did not create without explicitly granting them access to do so. 

#### How are you affected?
Tenant Administrators will lose access to view and manage **all tickets** for your tenant on the ‘Subscription Tickets’ page in the Auth0 Support Center on August 5, 2024. **You will still be able to access the Auth0 Support Center and create &amp;amp; manage the support tickets you created.**

#### What action do you need to take?
If you have a paid subscription, you can add yourself and any other users who need to see/manage all tickets (even those they did not create) across the tenant to the new **Elevated Support Access** role from the Auth0 Management Dashboard. __You should also review who__ __currently has the legacy ‘Support Access’ role assigned and determine if they should be removed and/or added to have the new Elevated Support Access role.__

If you are currently on a Free plan, there is no action required and this communication is to inform you that you will only be able to view and manage support tickets that you created.

                   <pubDate>Tue, 07 May 2024 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate>
                   <description>Forms for Actions is a new visual editor that allows you to build custom forms that can be used to **extend your login and signup flows with additional steps and business logic.**

                   <description>Auth0 Teams provides a platform to simplify viewing and management of environments, tenants and tenant members from a single pane of glass (Teams Dashboard).

We&amp;apos;ve updated the Teams Dashboard to include a new report called Team Activity under the *Reports* section of the Teams Dashboard.

Team Activity allows Team Owners to view and audit event logs generated by team members.
![Team Activity](//images.ctfassets.net/kbkgmx9upatd/5MrBUwuqoUWtYKeTmMsd3Y/be28933605891883329fa32ccde3ddb0/Team_Activity.png)

Team owners now have visibility to events such as team member invitations, team member role changes, changes to the team security policies, and changes to the team settings.

Team Activity Early Access is now available on the Enterprise plan. Please refer to [Auth0 Teams Documentation](https://auth0.com/docs/get-started/auth0-teams/team-activity &amp;quot;Team Activity Docs&amp;quot;) for more information.

Auth0 Teams is getting more exciting new features, and we can&amp;apos;t wait to share them with you.</description>

                   <description>Auth0 is happy to announce that __JSON Web Token (JWT) Profile for OAuth 2.0 Access Tokens - [RFC9068](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc9068/) is now available in Early Access for all customers__. You will be able to opt-in to use the new profile for your Access Tokens on a per-API basis.

With this release, we are adopting an Identity industry standard to maximize compatibility and interoperability with other solutions as well as reusability of community tools.

                   <description>Developers need to manage how applications are able to interact with an Okta FGA store. Some applications need full permissions, others write permissions, read permissions, or only permissions to update the authorization model.

You can now create multiple credentials for an Okta FGA store with different sets of permissions. So whether your client-facing application only needs read access while your Continuous Integration deployment needs the ability to write an authorization model, you are in control of security from the Okta FGA dashboard.

You can learn more by following the [How To Get Your API Keys](https://docs.fga.dev/integration/getting-your-api-keys) tutorial to create a new credential. </description>

                   <pubDate>Tue, 16 Apr 2024 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate>
                   <description>Okta CIC has added a privacy manifest file to the iOS Guardian app &amp;amp; SDK – the privacy manifest file describes the data that apps &amp;amp; third-party SDKs collect and supplies the reasons required APIs that the app &amp;amp; SDK use.

                   <title>Updates to WCAG 2.2 AA Compliance for Universal Login (Early Access)</title>
                   <pubDate>Tue, 16 Apr 2024 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate>
                   <description>Okta CIC is proud to announce the next round of improvements to Universal Login as part of our efforts to reach WCAG 2.2 AA guideline conformance. This release includes the following improvements.
* **Client-side validation of email addresses.** These validations follow the same formatting rules as the server-side validation
* **Accessible Labels.**  We cleaned up the duplicate labels in the HTML and properly associated them with their respective input fields.
* **Password Complexity Requirements.** These will now be properly announced by screen readers.
* **Announce Inline Error Message.** We added the proper aria attributes to the Inline error messages so that they can be understood and properly announced by screen readers.
* **Consistent Page Titles.** Every screen in our authorization flows now has a useful and distinct page title. 
*  **Visually Indicate Required Fields.** Required fields now include a visual indicator within the label.

                   <title>Modular Models for Okta FGA</title>
                   <pubDate>Mon, 15 Apr 2024 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate>
                   <description>Given authorization is application specific, the rules governing application authorization should be managed by the application team. 

Okta FGA now enables you to compose an authorization model from multiple modules. Each module lives in a different file, owned by each application team.

For example, if a company has 3 teams that own different components:

- The core authorization entities that are shared across the organization
- A wiki component
- An issue tracking component

Each team will be able to manage their own module in independent files whose ownership can be defined in your source control system (e.g. Github CODEOWNERS).

The modules will be combined in a single model when written to Okta FGA.

Learn more about Modular Models in the [Okta FGA documentation](https://docs.fga.dev/modeling/modular-models &amp;quot;Modular Models documentation&amp;quot;).

                   <title>Java Spring integration for Okta FGA</title>
                   <pubDate>Mon, 15 Apr 2024 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate>
                   <description>[Okta FGA](https://fga.dev) is now very easy to integrate with Java Spring Security, using the [OpenFGA Spring Boot Starter](https://github.com/openfga/spring-boot-starter).

In a nutshell, you can now use the @PreAuthorize Spring Security annotation with an `fga` bean that will require an authorization check to pass before executing a method:

    // Method body will only execute if the FGA check returns true. 403 otherwise.
    @PreAuthorize(&amp;quot;@fga.check(&amp;apos;document&amp;apos;, #docId, &amp;apos;reader&amp;apos;, &amp;apos;user&amp;apos;, authentication?.name)&amp;quot;)
    public Document getDocument(@PathVariable String docId) { 
       return repository.findById(id);
    }

                   <title>Progressive Factor Enrollment is now available!</title>
                   <pubDate>Tue, 19 Mar 2024 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate>
                   <description>Using the post-login action, you can now easily customize your MFA flows to prompt users to enroll in specific factors. After a user enrolls in a factor, they can use that factor as a secondary method of authentication in future logins. Customer Identity Cloud (CIC) now includes two new commands in the post-login API object: enrollWith and enrollWithAny. 

These commands, paired with our recent [Customize MFA Factor Selection](https://auth0.com/docs/secure/multi-factor-authentication/customize-mfa-selection-nul) feature release, allow you to specify precisely how to enroll and challenge the user with MFA factors based on contextual signals about the user, the organization, or the application they are logging into.

These changes provide greater flexibility with MFA to:
- design an authentication flow that reduces friction
- cater to your end-users’ preferences 
- align authentication with your organization&amp;apos;s security policies

You can read more about this new capability in our [Product Documentation](https://auth0.com/docs/secure/multi-factor-authentication/customize-mfa-enrollments).</description>

                   <description>End users can now enroll in One-time Password (OTP) Multi-factor Authentication (MFA) using the Guardian App or a custom app using the Guardian SDK on the same mobile device as the application. This allows users to complete OTP MFA enrollment flows using Guardian without having to scan a QR code.

                   <pubDate>Wed, 28 Feb 2024 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate>
                   <description>As part of our commitment to protect users, we are giving developers remote control of their users&amp;apos; authentication status through additional management API endpoints. These endpoints enable developers to list, explore, and terminate all or individual __sessions and refresh tokens__. 

Access to the [sessions via API](https://auth0.com/docs/manage-users/sessions/manage-user-sessions-with-auth0-management-api) endpoints is generally available to all customers with an Enterprise plan. Additionally, eligible customers have the opportunity to participate in the early access program for the [Refresh-Token API endpoints](https://auth0.com/docs/secure/tokens/manage-refresh-tokens-with-auth0-management-api). 

It is important to note that the newly introduced session revocation methods will soon incorporate the corresponding session-deleted along with [previous initiators](https://auth0.com/docs/authenticate/login/logout/back-channel-logout/oidc-back-channel-logout-initiators), progressively becoming available in the coming days.</description>

                   <description>At Okta, we take security seriously, so we made further updates as part of our continued efforts to help keep your Auth0 and Teams dashboard user accounts secure. Starting today, the session cookies of both Teams and Auth0 Dashboard dashboard users will now be bound to the originating Autonomous System Network (ASN) as part of the session creation.

What does this mean? Suppose, in an unforeseen situation, the session cookies are compromised. In that case, existing sessions will be invalidated, and the user hijacking the session will be forced to log in again if they attempt to access from a different workstation outside of the ASN bound to the session cookie.</description>

                   <description>__Initiators__ hook up to session termination events to request applications to log users out whenever that session is invalidated at Auth0. An initiator can be any cause of a session ending. This allows you to move from user-interactive single-logout to server-initiated distributed logout effortlessly on top of the __OIDC Back-Channel Logout__ specification.

This update includes __Account Deleted__ and __Email Changed__ in the existing list of logout initiators: __Password Changed__, __Session Expired__, and various __Logout__. Your applications can subscribe to individual or all initiators. For example, you can use Account Deleted to, in combination with OIDC Back-Channel Logout, remotely log the user out upon removing the account.

                   <pubDate>Thu, 01 Feb 2024 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate>
                   <description>Today we released support to choose whether you show an Enterprise Connection during Organization based logins. Similar to how Enterprise Connections work at the Application level, you can now navigate to Organizations -&amp;gt; “Your Organization” -&amp;gt; Connections -&amp;gt; “Your Connection” and then select whether you want to display that connection as a button on the login screen. 

Paired with Home Realm Discovery, this gives you powerful options to utilize hidden enterprise connections to support multiple customers using a single organization login, or hiding a support staff login from a customer’s organization.

                   <title>Passkeys are Generally Available</title>
                   <pubDate>Wed, 31 Jan 2024 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate>
                   <description>We’re excited to announce __passkeys are now Generally Available__ in the Okta Customer Identity Cloud to help businesses drive greater sign-up and sign-in conversion without compromising end-user security. 

This release builds off our existing [Early Access implementation](https://www.okta.com/press-room/press-releases/okta-launches-passkey-support-to-help-enterprises-unlock-a-passwordless/) and makes it easier for larger enterprises with a [custom database](https://auth0.com/docs/manage-users/user-migration#automatic-migrations) to adopt passkeys using lazy migration and reduce their customer&amp;apos;s reliance on passwords. We’ve also improved the developer experience by expanding our [SDK Libraries](https://auth0.com/docs/libraries) support.

With passkeys, Auth0 customers can transform their sign-in process, enjoying faster, easier, and more secure access to websites and applications. Passkeys are FIDO credentials that are discoverable by browsers or by security keys for passwordless authentication. Based on FIDO Alliance and World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) standards, passkeys replace the need for passwords by using cryptographic key pairs, ensuring robust protection against phishing and enhancing the overall user experience.

This feature will be gradually rolled out to all customers across all plans, starting Jan 31, 2024. Initially, it&amp;apos;ll be available in the public cloud, followed by a rollout in private cloud environments a few weeks later as per the release pipeline.

For your existing users with passwords, we offer a seamless progressive enrollment process to add passkeys for subsequent logins, ensuring a smooth transition to enhanced security.

Before you get started, please note that there are certain prerequisites to enable passkeys. Make sure to review these requirements in our [documentation](https://auth0.com/docs/authenticate/database-connections/passkeys/configure-passkey-policy) to ensure a seamless setup process.

Ready to try out passkeys in your application? Check out this [implementation post](https://www.okta.com/blog/2023/10/adding-passkeys-to-your-apps-with-okta-cic-powered-by-auth0/) and our [online documentation](https://auth0.com/docs/authenticate/database-connections/passkeys) for step-by-step guidance on configuration.</description>

                   <description>Enterprise customers with Public Cloud-based tenants may now receive request rates in excess of 100 RPS.  Public Performance is an add-on to a Customer’s existing Public Cloud deployment allowing for request rates up to 200 RPS for 48 hours per month.  The add-on is intended to provide customers the ability to grow their traffic on Auth0 in more affordable Public Cloud environments before upgrading to Private Cloud.

###### This release focused on the MFA Country Code Selector

Users that rely on screen readers will now have a much easier time navigating the country code selector. We also added a shiny new search/filter input to make it possible for all users to efficiently find and select their country code. These changes are already in production for most environments!

For administrators working within Auth0 Dashboard day to day, you will be prompted to re-authenticate after 12 hours from your last login activity.
This change does not affect any sessions configured for your end users interacting with your applications integrated with Auth0 identity services. The changes only apply to administrator sessions on Auth0 Dashboard.

                   <description>
Now, when attaching .HAR files within a ticket via Support.Auth0.com, the file is sanitized. To use:
1. Navigate to the Auth0 Support Center
2. Select Open Ticket
3. To trigger the file sanitization, simply attach/upload the .HAR file to the existing ticket or new ticket.
4. The file is sanitized at the client side before the file is uploaded to the portal.
5. The original trace is not uploaded prior to sanitization.
6. Filename after sanitization and upload: &amp;lt;file_name&amp;gt;_sanitized.har. You can download the sanitized file if you want to inspect it. 

Do not attempt to upload zipped or compressed HAR files because those files will not trigger the sanitization. Only .har files are processed.

*While Okta will attempt to identify sensitive data for you, you acknowledge that it is your responsibility, and not Okta’s, to identify sensitive data in HAR files that you want to be redacted.*

For more information on generating HAR files, see [this documentation](https://auth0.com/docs/troubleshoot/troubleshooting-tools/generate-and-analyze-har-files).</description>

                   <pubDate>Wed, 15 Nov 2023 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate>
                   <description>We are happy to share that we are expanding the use cases of OIDC Back-Channel Logout with new Logout Initiators (Early Access). 

__“Don&amp;apos;t call us, we&amp;apos;ll call you”__

What is this feature? Initiators hook up to session termination events to request applications to log users out whenever that session is invalidated at Auth0. __An initiator can be any cause of a session ending__, like a Password Changed or a Session Expired. This allows you to move from user-interactive single-logout to server-initiated distributed logout effortlessly on top of the OIDC Back-Channel Logout specification. 

__Want to know more?__ Check out our [public documentation](https://auth0.com/docs/authenticate/login/logout/back-channel-logout/oidc-back-channel-logout-initiators) and follow our updates as we incorporate more functionalities. This functionally requires access to the [OIDC Back-Channel Logout](https://auth0.com/docs/authenticate/login/logout/back-channel-logout) functionality already generally available for enterprise plans.</description>

                   <description>You asked, we listened and delivered! Introducing the much anticipated Teams feature, Tenant Member Management. Designed to help you centrally manage your onboarding and off-boarding workflow of tenant dashboard members. 

We have received much feedback from our users, and this feature will significantly improve your experience with our product.

Here are some key benefits of Teams Tenant Member Management:
- Team Owners centrally grant dashboard users access to one or more tenants.
- Assign Team Members more than one App at a time for Editor - Specific Apps role.
- A new &amp;quot;Contributor&amp;quot; role for Team Members, to view and access specific tenants they are members from Teams Dashboard.
- Just In Time, Team members&amp;apos; accounts are auto-created in Teams based on successful login using your enterprise IdP.

Want to experience improved account management with friction-reducing Teams Tenant Member Management? Our [documentation](https://auth0.com/docs/get-started/tenant-settings/auth0-teams/tenant-member-management &amp;quot;Tenant Member Management&amp;quot;) will guide you on how to turn on the feature.![Teams Member Management](//images.ctfassets.net/kbkgmx9upatd/4McC8XT1PfQ46OZ3L3kWXh/81e68b5693fe7f5cda3b2377191d8ff6/Team_Member_Details_Page.png)</description>

                   <pubDate>Wed, 08 Nov 2023 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate>
                   <description>We have recently enhanced our Adaptive MFA risk assessment object to expose three additional phone attributes: line type, region, and provider!

In combination with Actions you can customize your Adaptive MFA flow to leverage and trigger challenges based on these new attributes in the risk assessment object.

To read more about the new phone attributes in the Adaptive MFA, you can check out our online documentation [here](https://auth0.com/docs/secure/multi-factor-authentication/adaptive-mfa/customize-adaptive-mfa#phonenumber-assessment).

                   <description>Using the post login action, you can now easily define which secondary factor, or sequence of factors, your end-users are challenged with for MFA in the login flow. Customer Identity Cloud (CIC) now includes two new commands in the post login API object: challengeWith and challengeWithAny. 

With these commands, you can specify how to challenge the user with MFA factors based on contextual signals about the user, the organization, or the application they are logging into.

These changes provide greater flexibility with MFA to:
- design an authentication flow that reduces friction
- cater to your end-users’ preferences 
- align authentication with your organization&amp;apos;s security policies

You can read more about this new capability in our [Product Documentation](https://auth0.com/docs/secure/multi-factor-authentication/customize-mfa-selection-nul).</description>

                   <description>We have updated the experience for the Production Readiness Check tool in the Auth0 Management Dashboard.

The Production Readiness Check tool now provides:
- The ability to &amp;apos;dismiss&amp;apos; a check while keeping it available to restore at the bottom of the page
- A progress gauge as a clear visual indicator of tenant production readiness
- __Failed__ and __Passed__ expandable objects within a single page (replaced the former tabbed layout)
- __Critical__ labels to denote that a check has security or end-user implications.

*Note: The Production Readiness Check tool now _only_ lives in the Auth0 Management Dashboard. Previously, it also lived in [Auth0 Support Center](https://support.auth0.com/) but has now been centralized in the Dashboard.

To learn more about the Production Readiness Check tool, see [this documentation](https://auth0.com/docs/deploy-monitor/pre-deployment-checks/how-to-run-production-checks#production-check-results)

This has no impact on existing customers and tenants, but we encourage all customers to migrate their Rules and Actions before Nov 18, 2024, the end of life for Rules and Hooks.  We have provided a [Migration Guide](https://auth0.com/extensibility/movetoactions) to help our customers get started.

                   <pubDate>Tue, 03 Oct 2023 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate>
                   <description>[OpenID Connect Back-Channel Logout](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-backchannel-1_0.html) allows you to implement end-users single-logout through direct communication between the identity provider (IdP) and an application backend. When configured, any Single Sign-On (SSO) application can leverage the session identifier (sid) included in ID Tokens to react to the session termination events received in OIDC Back-Channel Logout Tokens.

Back-channel communication is a reliable mechanism to coordinate application logout and avoid limitations imposed by the need for an active browser or third-party content browser restrictions.
[OIDC Back-Channel Logout in our public documentation](https://auth0.com/docs/authenticate/login/logout/back-channel-logout)
This capability is a practical solution for applications with a backend that can keep and manage the state of a user session. Learn more about . The feature will be gradually rolled out to all customers on one of our enterprise plans.</description>

                   <title>Introducing Passkeys: Enhance Your Sign-In Experience with Early Access</title>
                   <pubDate>Thu, 07 Sep 2023 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate>
                   <description>We&amp;apos;re excited to introduce passkeys, a cutting-edge feature now available in **Early Access**! With passkeys, Auth0 customers can transform their sign-in process, enjoying faster, easier, and more secure access to websites and applications. Passkeys are FIDO credentials that are discoverable by browsers or security keys for passwordless authentication. Based on FIDO Alliance and World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) standards, passkeys replace the need for passwords by using cryptographic key pairs, ensuring robust protection against phishing and enhancing the overall user experience.

For your existing users with passwords, we offer a seamless progressive enrollment process to add passkeys for subsequent logins, ensuring a smooth transition to enhanced security.

Before you get started, please note that there are certain prerequisites to enable passkeys. Make sure to review these requirements in our [documentation](https://auth0.com/docs/authenticate/database-connections/passkeys) to ensure a seamless setup process.

With **Early Access**, this feature will be gradually rolled out to all customers across all plans, starting September 7th, 2023 . Initially, it&amp;apos;ll be available in the public cloud, followed by a rollout in private cloud environments a few weeks later as per our release pipeline. For our valued Private Cloud customers, enabling passkeys is as simple as reaching out to your account team for assistance. To learn more about our release stages, please refer to [Product Release Stages](https://auth0.com/docs/troubleshoot/product-lifecycle/product-release-stages).

Curious about setting up passkeys? Explore our [online documentation](https://auth0.com/docs/authenticate/database-connections/passkeys) for step-by-step guidance on configuration.</description>

                   <pubDate>Wed, 30 Aug 2023 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate>
                   <description>Starting today, we are rolling out advanced capabilities of SAML Mapping, Root-Level User Attributes, and Access Token Scope to Actions. Developers can effectively leverage these newly added capabilities in Actions to unblock unique use cases and complete migrations from legacy Rules and Hooks. 

__Key Highlights__

__SAML Mapping and Configuration__: Developers can effectively use SAML mapping to map user attributes and claims from SAML assertion assertions to user profiles with Actions when creating and customizing the login and user registration flow.

__Access Token Scope__: Developers can freely add or remove claims scopes with newly created custom API with security enhancement.

                   <pubDate>Tue, 15 Aug 2023 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate>
                   <description>We are thrilled to announce the general availability of react-native-auth0 v3! This release is a significant transformation in our React Native SDK, aligning with the latest developments in the React Native framework.

                   <pubDate>Wed, 09 Aug 2023 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate>
                   <description>To make Organizations easier to use, Auth0 now supports using the Organization Name to launch login flows via the [Authentication API](https://auth0.com/docs/api/authentication). More specifically, the [/authorize](https://auth0.com/docs/api/authentication#authorize-application) and [/samlp (SAML)](https://auth0.com/docs/api/authentication#saml) endpoints have now the option to accept Organization Names instead of Organization IDs.

To learn more about how to activate and use this feature, as well as the security implications to bear in mind, [read more details in Auth0 docs](https://auth0.com/docs/manage-users/organizations/configure-organizations/use-org-name-authentication-api).

                   <title>Bot Detection is Now Integrated with Friendly Captcha and hCaptcha!</title>
                   <pubDate>Thu, 03 Aug 2023 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate>
                   <description>We have expanded our captcha response providers in our Bot Detection product. Now, you can seamlessly integrate with Friendly Captcha and hCaptcha.

Friendly Captcha is a proof of work captcha. Not only does it provide a frictionless user experience, but it also imposes significant computational costs on attackers, making it highly effective against malicious activities.

In addition, we’ve added hCaptcha as an alternative to reCAPTCHA Enterprise. hCaptcha offers a similar user experience while offering different stances on privacy and data collection. It also provides wider regional availability, ensuring that our customers can benefit from comprehensive bot detection regardless of their location.

To learn more about our Bot Detection solution, please refer to our [online documentation](https://auth0.com/docs/secure/attack-protection/bot-detection#configure-bot-detection).

                   <title>Custom Domains in Guardian SDKs</title>
                   <pubDate>Thu, 27 Jul 2023 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate>
                   <description>The Guardian iOS and Andriod SDKs support custom domains!

With a custom domain, your users feel confident that they are providing their credentials to the right party. Authentication happens within the context of your brand which helps you build brand loyalty. Users are not redirected to a third-party site that breaks the branding context. This prevents users from becoming confused about whether they are still making a transaction or operation with you.

Containing your authentication services in one place makes your application architecture more maintainable. Applications gain only the access they need and authentication services scale easily. Other security benefits of using a custom domain include:
- Some browsers, by default, make it difficult to communicate in an iFrame if you don&amp;apos;t have a shared domain.
- It&amp;apos;s harder to phish your domain if you have a vanity URL because the phisher must create a vanity URL to mimic yours. For example, with a custom domain, you can use your own certificate to get an Extended Validation, making phishing harder.

                   <title>Bot Detection Slider for Bot Detection </title>
                   <pubDate>Thu, 27 Jul 2023 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate>
                   <description>Now announcing the Bot Detection Slider for Bot Detection!

We have added the ability to adjust the level of friction of the “When Risky” setting on our Bot Detection model.

There are three settings to choose from __Low__, __Medium__, and __High__.

__Low__ - a more relaxed security stance, resulting in less friction for users.

__Medium__ - a balanced and recommended setting for a balanced experience of security and user friction

__High__ -  will take a more strict security approach, increasing user friction but applying a more assertive security stance.

With this new addition, the ability to adjust your detection to match your business needs and risk tolerance is just a setting away!

See the online documentation [here](https://auth0.com/docs/secure/attack-protection/bot-detection#use-bot-detection-slider),  for additional information on bot detection and on how to use the bot detection slider.</description>

                   <description>We have added a new Auth0 Management Dashboard Role: __Editor - Organizations__. Now, we’ve created a way for you to provide more specific Organizations Administration access in order to allow other tenant members to create, configure, and maintain your Organizations.

                   <description>OIDC and Okta Workforce connections now support PKCE and attribute mapping.  PKCE enables you to build more secure connections between Auth0 and your connected identity provider.  With attribute mapping you can sync more attributes from your IdP into your Auth0 tenant.  This enables you to ensure your tenant is leveraging the latest user information from the connected IdP.

                   <description>Node.js 18 is now generally available (GA) for Actions, Rules and Hooks. Starting today, all tenants in public cloud will receive Node 18 support. Customers on Converged private cloud platform will receive Node 18 in the following weeks subject to your private cloud release schedule.  

To adhere to best code security practices, we strongly encourage customers to update to Node 18, before September 11th, 2023 when Node 16 long-term support ends.

Customer can start using Node 18 in their tenants setting and/or when creating new Actions in the Auth0 Manage Dashboard.

                   <description>Today we’ve released upgrades to how login flows work for applications using Organizations to build [multi-tenant SaaS apps](https://auth0.com/docs/get-started/auth0-overview/create-tenants/multi-tenant-apps-best-practices). We’ve created options for tying identifier first [Home Realm Discovery](https://auth0.com/docs/authenticate/login/auth0-universal-login/identifier-first#define-home-realm-discovery-identity-providers) to Connections with IdP domains associated with Organizations. We’ve also released a New Universal Login Prompt that displays when configured for end users with multiple organization memberships. Those users can now select which Organization they want to login with after authenticating.

                   <description>Auth0 Enterprise plans can now use OIDC Back-Channel Logout capabilities for Session Management in their production tenants. This allows you to implement responsive single-logout experiences for end-users, avoiding limitations imposed by third-party cookie browser restrictions and setting the foundation for remote logout capabilities. 

When configured, any SSO application can leverage the session identifier (sid) included in ID Tokens to react to the session termination events received in OIDC Back-Channel Logout Tokens. 

The feature is available upon opt-in request to all enterprise plans and will be automatically enabled by default soon after.

                   <description>Auth0 Enterprise customers on Converged Platform can now use Security Center, a new security feature that provides real time monitoring of potential security events. It provides a more proactive approach to our customers on understanding and tweaking their attack protection program, and further strengthen the security posture with real-time monitoring capability of common attack types and metrics on the current attack protection features.

The feature will be rolled out in stages to all Enterprise customers using Private and Public Cloud on the Converged Platform beginning on May 4, 2023.

Security Center includes trends on common threat behaviors- including credential stuffing attacks, sign up attacks, and MFA bypass attacks. It also provides threat monitoring capability on our current attack protection program - including Bot Detection, Brute-force Protection, Suspicious IP Throttling and Breached Password Detection. The threat monitoring tool helps our customers understand the current attack trends on their tenant traffic, and then implement countermeasures by enabling and tweaking the Auth0 Attack Protection feature sets.

To learn more, please refer [Security Center](https://auth0.com/docs/secure/security-center) in the Auth0 Docs.

                   <description>Auth0 now supports **Private Key JWT in [General Availability](https://auth0.com/docs/troubleshoot/product-lifecycle/product-release-stages#general-availability), a more secure and flexible way to authenticate your Auth0 Apps**:  
* Enhance security by generating **asymmetric public/private key pairs** for use as credentials. Once you register the public key with Auth0, you use the private key to sign the request sent to the Authentication API for a more secure experience.
* Renew credentials seamlessly with **key rotation**. Have two keys active simultaneously for **zero downtime**.

![Private Key JWT in Credentials tab](//images.ctfassets.net/kbkgmx9upatd/1aOnERRxJFEZ8QPkeFwAaF/01e96d4822ebc7e030a579c8ff7f7556/PKJWT_announcement.png)

Private Key JWT is our first protocol capability shipped to enable **[FAPI](https://openid.net/wg/fapi/) compliance** for Financial Grade APIs and other Highly Regulated Identity scenarios. Stay tuned for further updates!

Private Key JWT is available to customers on the Enterprise subscription plan. To activate, visit the new Credentials tab within the Auth0 Dashboard or the Management API. The main Auth0 SDK also support this new App Authentication Method. Read our [Auth0 Docs](https://auth0.com/docs/secure/application-credentials) to learn more. </description>

                   <description>Announcing the [general availability](https://auth0.com/docs/troubleshoot/product-lifecycle/product-release-stages#general-availability &amp;quot;General Availability Description&amp;quot;) release of Auth0 CLI v1, a significant milestone moving Auth0 CLI from an experimental build to an officially supported tool, offering a range of powerful features and enhancements tailored to streamline your Auth0 development process. Key highlights include an improved authentication process, allowing you to authenticate as a user via device flow or as a machine with client credentials; the new &amp;apos;api&amp;apos; command for making authenticated HTTP requests to the Management API directly; and over 70 other improvements, feature enhancements and bug fixes.

                   <description>### Organization Membership added to User Search 🕵️‍♀️

In order to support our customers with multi-tenant applications, we’ve updated [User Search](https://auth0.com/docs/manage-users/user-search) to support the `organization_id` parameter so that you can search for and filter users based on their [Organization](https://auth0.com/docs/manage-users/organizations) membership. This is available in the Manage Dashboard for your support teams as well as via the [Management API](https://auth0.com/docs/api/management/v2#!/Users/get_users) so that you can enable your business customers&amp;apos; team members to search for users in their Organization from within your application.

Details and examples can be found [here](https://auth0.com/docs/manage-users/organizations/configure-organizations/search-organization-members).</description>

                   <pubDate>Tue, 04 Apr 2023 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate>
                   <description>We&amp;apos;re delighted to announce General Availability of the latest Public Cloud environment in United Kingdom (UK)!

Auth0 strives to offer the best CIAM solution in all aspects. The addition of this region (to Public Cloud environments available globally) enables low-latency IAM experience and addreses data residency requirements for UK customers.

The UK region has been available in Beta mode, and thousands of customers have experienced it successfully since November 2022.

Auth0 customers are now able to choose the UK region during tenant creation process. The newly created Auth0 tenant will have [tenant].uk.auth0.com domain name.

                   <description>The Dashboard Activity page has been reimagined and now provides dashboard admins with access to visualized metrics that give them a high-level understanding of their tenant application signup and login data.

Initially, Tenants will be able to track metrics over time, such as Active Users, Sign-ups, and Retention, in addition to Failed logins. Auth0 will consistently add additional functionality and features to improve the user experience.

This feature is now available to all customers.

                   <description>Announcing the [general availability](https://auth0.com/docs/troubleshoot/product-lifecycle/product-release-stages#general-availability) release of auth0-java v2, the latest release of our authentication and management SDK for Java applications. This release brings a variety of exciting new features and improvements, including:

- A new pluggable HTTP component with a configurable default implementation, making it easier to handle simple and complex use cases.
- HTTP request configuration enabled for all requests, eliminating the need to downcast and simplifying our internal request class hierarchy.
- HTTP response information is returned for all API calls, making it easier to retrieve important information, such as response headers, without having to inspect logs.
- Improvements to the Authentication API client, like no longer requiring a client secret, allowing callers of APIs that don&amp;apos;t need a secret to use the client.

                   <pubDate>Tue, 07 Feb 2023 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate>
                   <description>Auth0 has released Security Center, a new security feature to provide our customers with real-time monitoring of potential security events as they happen. It provides a more proactive approach to our customers on understanding and tweaking their attack protection program, and further strengthen the security posture  with real-time monitoring capability of common attack types and metrics on the current attack protection features.

This feature is in Early Access and will initially be rolled out in stages to all Enterprise customers using Private Cloud on the Converged Platform beginning on February 7, 2023. To learn more about our release stages, read [Product Release Stages](https://auth0.com/docs/troubleshoot/product-lifecycle/product-release-stages). The feature can be accessed from [Auth0 Dashboard](https://manage.auth0.com/#/security/center).

                   <pubDate>Tue, 29 Nov 2022 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate>
                   <description>We are bringing caching in Actions to the public cloud. Available immediately, customers can use *api.cache* to store and retrieve data that persists across executions.

Requesting and storing tokens over time for external services or machine-to-machine exchanges can drive up overhead costs and further cause latency issues. So we created Actions caching, a means to minimize the number of machine-to-machine access tokens generated to authenticate with Auth0 APIs. 

Check out our detailed guidance on [Auth0 Docs](https://auth0.com/docs/customize/actions/flows-and-triggers/login-flow/api-object), and visit [Move to Actions](http://auth0.com/extensibility/movetoactions) today to start using Auth0&amp;apos;s flagship extensibility product, Actions.

                   <pubDate>Tue, 15 Nov 2022 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate>
                   <description>SMS as an MFA option for loging into Auth0 Dashboard is now only available for  users on a paid subscription.

__What happens with free tenants with SMS as an MFA option enabled before the change?__ Already enrolled users will continue to receive SMS-generated OTP. However, SMS as an MFA will no longer be presented on a free tenant if the dashboard user disables it. The tenant will need to be added to a paid subscription to continue using the feature after disabling it.

                   <pubDate>Wed, 09 Nov 2022 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate>
                   <description>Beginning May 9th, 2023, the [Get Role Users Management API endpoint](https://auth0.com/docs/api/management/v2#!/Roles/get_role_user) will only return greater than 1,000 total results if the checkpoint pagination method is used. This pagination method is optimized to support large quantities of results. The offset pagination method will be capped at 1,000 results.

See the [Get Role Users Management API Documentation](https://auth0.com/docs/api/management/v2#!/Roles/get_role_user) for implementation details on the two pagination methods.</description>

                   <pubDate>Wed, 09 Nov 2022 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate>
                   <description>Auth0 is excited to announce the launch of a new public cloud environment in the United Kingdom (UK) as a Beta. This new environment joins previously available environments in the United States, Australia, Japan, and the European Union, as we continue to support our customer&amp;apos;s needs to offer low-latency login experiences while complying with data locality regulations. 

Auth0 customers can specify their preferred location by simply choosing the United Kingdom region during the tenant creation process. The new Auth0 tenant created will have the `[tenant].uk.auth0.com` domain name and will adhere to amended terms of service and SLA during the Beta period.

                   <pubDate>Thu, 03 Nov 2022 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate>
                   <description>In order to support our customer’s growing SaaS businesses, we are excited to announce support for Organizations context in custom database scripts.  This will make it easier to migrate users from your existing B2B applications to Auth0. 

Customers can now enable the additional custom database parameter __Context object in database scripts__.  
![enable context ](//images.ctfassets.net/kbkgmx9upatd/poRt588AegOTIvy41Zvu0/fab666841dce27ae977404024ee8a007/enable_context.png)
Once enabled, the custom database action script will be passed an extra parameter, `context`, that contains information about the Organization that an end-user is interacting with.
![orgs json](//images.ctfassets.net/kbkgmx9upatd/53VqbkIFY5SrM6Zi6Y59ge/5560df6e2f977569adbf0999979405cb/orgs_json.jpg)

                   <description>Starting October 31, we are rolling out a new Okta Workforce Enterprise Connection.

The Okta Workforce Enterprise Connection makes it easy for business customers to offer your product to their employees through their Okta dashboard, with seamless integration to Okta Workforce Identity Cloud. This enterprise connection is now free for all Okta B2B and Enterprise customers, and easier to discover and configure in Auth0.

                   <pubDate>Sat, 22 Oct 2022 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate>
                   <description>We’ve reduced session timeout due to inactivity – for administrator sessions on manage.auth0.com – to 12 hours. This is another routine step in our continuous improvements in the security of our services.

For many of our customer’s administrators, there will be no noticeable effect. For those administrators working in manage.auth0.com day to day, additional or more frequent challenges to log in — if you’ve been inactive for 12+ hours — will be the only effect.

This change does not affect any sessions configured for your users and your applications as integrated with Auth0 identity services. The only changes are for administrator sessions on manage.auth0.com.</description>

                   <description>#### __Now announcing the ability to block breached credentials on sign-up with Breach Password Detection!__

With the previous version of  Breached Password Detection, we have the ability to block log-ins when a set of known breached credentials are used for a user&amp;apos;s account. We have now added the ability to enable the same functionality with the signup process.

Within the Breach Password Detection dashboard, there is now a toggle to turn on Breached Password Detection for account creation. Once on, the user, upon trying to create an account with a set of known breached credentials, will receive a prompt informing them that a combination of credentials was detected in a public breach and to use a different password.

                   <pubDate>Wed, 14 Sep 2022 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate>
                   <description>We are excited to bring a new version (v3) of Post-login Trigger in Actions to our customers. This backwards-compatible version update effectively enhances the security safeguard and brings new features to Actions. You can read the summary below and find out more information in our release [docs](https://auth0.com/docs/customize/actions/flows-and-triggers/login-flow/releases).

### Breaking Changes

__*api.redirect.canRedirect()*__ marked as deprecated.

__*api.redirect.sendUserTo()*__ will no longer skip redirecting when in a non-interactive flow. This means that calls to api.redirect.sendUserTo() should first check if the redirect is needed before issuing the redirect.

### New Features

__*event.authentication.methods()*__ may now also contain custom methods completed by users within that session and recorded using api.authentication.recordMethod() from the onContinuePostLogin handler.

__*api.authentication.recordMethod()*__ is added as a way to store a record for the completion of a custom method in the user’s session. These APIs allow you to strictly require custom factors for certain scenarios.

To learn more about v1 and v2 updates, follow [Actions releases notes](https://auth0.com/docs/customize/actions/releases).</description>

With this change, the options under the bell icon on the right side of the Manage banner no longer redirect to the Auth0 Support Center, but rather allow you to check your notifications without leaving the dashboard.</description>

                   <description>Auth0 Teams provides a single point of visibility and control over your enterprise tenants. Teams [First Availability](https://auth0.com/docs/troubleshoot/product-lifecycle/product-release-stages) is opened to customers with Enterprise tenants in Auth0&amp;apos;s Public Cloud. The following features are available as part of Auth0 teams:
- Visibility into tenants and tenant administrators.
- Visibility and control of Team members.
- Ability to restrict tenant creation.

Please refer to [Auth0 Teams Documentation](https://auth0.com/docs/get-started/tenant-settings/auth0-teams) for more information.
Contact your Technical Account Manager or Auth0 Support to enable Auth0 Teams and begin the journey of centralized visibility and control with us. More exciting new features are coming to Auth0 Teams, and we can&amp;apos;t wait to share them with you. Please continue to look for Auth0 Teams product announcements in the future.

                   <title>Ability to set Non-Namespaced Custom Claims is now generally available</title>
                   <pubDate>Thu, 28 Jul 2022 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate>
                   <description>Auth0 already supported adding custom claims to tokens via extensibility (Hooks / Rules / Actions), however, until today it **restricted the usage of custom claims to public namespaced custom claims**. This caused limitations for some onboarding scenarios and for implementing some standards that require private non-namespaced custom claims (such as FHIR for health care).
Today, these barriers are gone! **Customers can add non-namespaced custom claims to Access and ID Tokens in OIDC flows**. 

``` 
// an Auth0 action
exports.onExecutePostLogin = async (event, api) =&amp;gt; {
  // this was restricted, this is now allowed !
  api.accessToken.setCustomClaim(&amp;apos;favourite_color&amp;apos;, &amp;apos;blue&amp;apos;);
  api.idToken.setCustomClaim(&amp;apos;favourite_star_wars_droid&amp;apos;, &amp;apos;n2c2&amp;apos;);
}
```

- **Non-namespaced custom claims set on ID Tokens will be returned in the `/userinfo` endpoint**.
- **New restrictions apply**:
  - Token size is capped to 100KB in all OIDC flows.
  - A list of claims (standard and auth0 internal) will be restricted and customers won’t be able overwrite them.
  - Creation of non-namespaced custom claims on tokens with Auth0 audiences are restricted to avoid collision with Auth0 internal services.

To learn more, read [JSON Web Token Claims](https://auth0.com/docs/secure/tokens/json-web-tokens/json-web-token-claims) and [Create Custom Claims](https://auth0.com/docs/secure/tokens/json-web-tokens/create-custom-claims) in the Auth0 Docs.

If you were already using a previous, non-generally available mechanism to set non-namespaced custom claims, please read our [Migration Guide](https://auth0.com/docs/troubleshoot/product-lifecycle/deprecations-and-migrations/custom-claims-migration).</description>

                   <pubDate>Thu, 21 Jul 2022 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate>
                   <description>Announcing the [general availability](https://auth0.com/docs/troubleshoot/product-lifecycle/product-release-stages#general-availability &amp;quot;General Availability Product Lifecycle&amp;quot;) release of SimpleKeychain v1 and JWTDecode.swift v3, our utility libraries for storing user credentials in iCloud Keychain and decoding JWTs in iOS, macOS, tvOS, and watchOS apps. Both releases aim to modernize the libraries, dropping support for Objective-C, older versions of Swift, and outdated platform versions.

To get started building with SimpleKeychain and JWTDecode.swift, you can view the latest release notes and migration guides on GitHub.
- [SimpleKeychain](https://github.com/auth0/SimpleKeychain/releases/tag/1.0.0)
- [JWTDecode.swift](https://github.com/auth0/JWTDecode.swift/releases/tag/3.0.0)

Looking to extend this functionality and easily integrate Auth0 into iOS and Mac apps? Check out our [Auth0.swift](https://github.com/auth0/Auth0.swift &amp;quot;Auth0.swift SDK&amp;quot;) SDK which supports SimpleKeychain, JWTDecode, and more.</description>

                   <title>Node 16 is coming to Rules and Hooks</title>
                   <pubDate>Tue, 19 Jul 2022 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate>
                   <description>Starting Jul 25, 2022 we are rolling out Node 16 to support Auth0 Rules and Hooks, and we recommend our developer customers [update the tenant global setting](https://auth0.com/docs/troubleshoot/product-lifecycle/deprecations-and-migrations/migrate-to-nodejs-16) to Node.js 16, or [migrate Legacy Rules/Hooks](https://auth0.com/docs/customize/actions/migrate/migrate-from-rules-to-actions) to Actions.

Node.js 12 [is no longer supported](https://nodejs.org/en/about/releases/) and has exited Long Term Support (LTS), but it will remain available for Rules and Hooks for the time being. We encourage you to migrate your Rules and Hooks to Node.js 16 at a minimum. Ultimately we strongly encourage our developer community to migrate your Rules &amp;amp; Hooks to Auth0 Actions for [a greatly improved developer experience](https://auth0.com/blog/introducing-auth0-actions/). We plan to support every current and long-term supported Node version in the future through Actions exclusively.

To take advantage of Node 16 for Rules and Hooks, simply select Node 16 for your tenants&amp;apos; Extensibility, Runtime setting (under Advanced Settings in the tenant dashboard). Your existing Rules and Hooks will then default to Node 16, so we recommend testing in a non-production tenant first. If you need to revert your Rules and Hooks to a previous version, you can revert back to Node 12 as well. We&amp;apos;ll release more information about the Node 16 upgrade in our Docs shortly, and will update this Changelog when done.

For customers using our flagship extensibility product Auth0 Actions, there will be no changes. Our long-term strategy is to unify all extensibility under Actions. We also encourage you to explore Actions Integrations - a modern approach to extensibility without Node version disruption. All Actions Integrations will run on Node 16 at launch, and will be maintained by Auth0 and our Marketplace Partners.

We want to hear from you. Please share any feedback on your experience with our extensibility tools and Actions in [our Developer Community](https://community.auth0.com/c/actions/91).</description>

                   <title>Sign in With Apple -  Supporting User Delete Requirement</title>
                   <pubDate>Wed, 29 Jun 2022 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate>
                   <description>Starting June 30, 2022 applications using __Sign in With Apple (SIWA)__ for account creation must also let users initiate deletion of their account from within the app. Apple offers the following guidance at [https://developer.apple.com/support/offering-account-deletion-in-your-app](https://developer.apple.com/support/offering-account-deletion-in-your-app) :

* Make the account deletion option easy to find in your app. Typically, it’s included in the app’s account settings.
* Offer to delete the entire account record, along with associated personal data. You may include additional options, but only offering to temporarily deactivate or disable an account is insufficient.
* If people need to visit a website to finish deleting their account, include a link directly to the page on your website where they can complete the process.
* Keep users informed. If the deletion request will take additional time to complete, let them know. If your app supports in-app purchases, help people understand how billing and cancellations will be handled.

For Auth0 customers this can be done by a call to the Management API v2 endpoint 

__DELETE/users/%user_id% __

In addition, Apple now requires token revocation for the deleted user to remove the authorization from the list of applications on the user Apple account. In order to provide a complete solution, we have made an update to our SIWA integration. Auth0 will store and then revoke the Apple token on a user that has been created via SIWA on behalf of our customers. So no further action is necessary beyond user deletion to satisfy the new Apple requirement.</description>

                   <title>Organizations – Enterprise Scalability Improvements</title>
                   <pubDate>Fri, 03 Jun 2022 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate>
                   <description>In order to support our customers&amp;apos; growing SaaS businesses, we have introduced some scalability improvements for Auth0 Organizations. 

Customers can now Search for Organizations in the Manage Dashboard, and those on our Enterprise subscription plan can request increased entity limits for Organizations and Organization Members. Both can now be raised up to 2M (2,000,000) on a per-tenant basis.

![Organization Search](//images.ctfassets.net/kbkgmx9upatd/12PIvXNMTpxCritlyOxcey/3cce4b34dd2a71e3479283009fdd7a6f/orgs-search__1_.png)

To request an entity limit increase, please connect with your technical account manager or create a support ticket in your Enterprise subscription which includes the following:

- Description of your use-case and the reason for needing an increase
- Which limit needs the increase (number of Organizations, or number of Organization members per-organization)
- The name and region of the Auth0 tenants that need the increase applied

                   <title>Bot Detection Upgraded with Machine Learning to Reduce Bot Attacks by 79%</title>
                   <pubDate>Tue, 31 May 2022 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate>
                   <description>Auth0 Bot Detection in public cloud is now upgraded with a new machine learning engine to help reduce bot attacks by 79%, with minimal impact on user experience. 

Part of the Auth0 Attack Protection add-on, Bot Detection now pairs machine learning with one of the world’s largest consumer identity platforms to screen more bots in nearly 90% of attacks compared to the previous iteration. The impact on user experience remains unchanged, as even during attacks, fewer than 1% of challenges are shown to humans. Better security shouldn’t mean more friction.

To learn more about bot detection, see the [Auth0 Bot Detection documentation](https://auth0.com/docs/secure/attack-protection/bot-detection).

                   <description>The Bulk User Export will now escape string data types in the CSV export file.  This is in conformance with OWASP standards for CSV injection mitigation.  To ensure the content is read as text:

- Double quote characters are prepended with a double quote character.
- Each string is prepended with a single quote character.
- Each string is wrapped in double quotes.

This does not apply to dates in ISO 8601 format.

                   <pubDate>Tue, 05 Apr 2022 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate>
                   <description>Announcing an improvement to Auth0’s security and performance with refresh token limits. We are limiting the amount of refresh tokens to 200 active tokens per user per application. Our service will periodically scan for client applications that keep an excess of active user refresh tokens and remove the excess on an older-first basis.

Limiting the amount of refresh tokens helps prevent accidental creation and accumulation of unnecessary or forgotten tokens while also preventing performance side-effects and signaling anomalous authentication flows via [Refresh token excess warning](https://auth0.com/docs/deploy-monitor/logs/log-event-type-codes) in [tenant logs](https://auth0.com/docs/deploy-monitor/logs/view-log-events).

                   <title>Credential Guard Now Available</title>
                   <pubDate>Mon, 07 Feb 2022 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate>
                   <description>Auth0 has released Credential Guard, a new security feature that protects your users and your enterprise from password theft. Credential Guard augments Auth0’s automated breached password detection feature, mitigating worldwide data breaches sooner, often before they’re made public. The new Enterprise add-on reduces the risk of data breaches to your application by up to 80%.

Breached password detection relies on public announcements of large-scale data breaches. If your user’s credentials (based on their email address) have been exposed in a public data breach, Auth0 can automatically alert your users, challenge them with an additional authentication factor, or block access until they reset their password. 

With the Credential Guard add-on, a dedicated team of security professionals infiltrates criminal communities and gains access to exposed data as soon as breaches occur, often many months before any public announcement. With this advantage, you can better protect your users and secure your applications by resetting stolen passwords sooner.

Credential Guard protects your enterprise from data breaches across more than 35 languages and 200 countries and territories. It helps you eliminate the costs associated with account takeovers, while also protecting your users&amp;apos; accounts.

Credential Guard:
* Exposes more than ten times the data breaches
* Reveals breached credentials more quickly
* Increases global coverage by adding data feeds for passwords in non-Roman characters

Enterprise plan customers can add Credential Guard to their Auth0 agreement and then enable it from the [Auth0 Dashboard](https://manage.auth0.com/#/security/attack-protection/breached-password)

If you have the Attack Protection add-on, you already have access to this feature. You can enable Credential Guard from the [Auth0 Dashboard](https://manage.auth0.com/#/security/attack-protection/breached-password): locate **Breached Password Detection method**, select **As soon as possible, with Credential Guard, and** select **Save**.

To learn more, read [Breached Password Detection](https://auth0.com/docs/secure/attack-protection/breached-password-detection) in the Auth0 Docs.</description>

                   <description>Announcing the [general availability](https://auth0.com/docs/troubleshoot/product-lifecycle/product-release-stages#general-availability) release of [go-jwt-middleware](https://github.com/auth0/go-jwt-middleware) V2, our SDK for checking and validating JWTs in Go applications. The V2 release of our go-jwt-middleware is a giant leap forward from our V1 implementation. Updates include simplifying the JWT library interface, support for JWKS, and much more. Please note, this update contains breaking changes. 

To get started experimenting with the latest release, check out our updated [migration guide](https://github.com/auth0/go-jwt-middleware/blob/v2.0.0-beta/MIGRATION_GUIDE.md). </description>

                   <title>Auth0 expands caching for common Authentication API requests</title>
                   <pubDate>Mon, 13 Dec 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate>
                   <description>Auth0 has implemented a cache of additional entities stored in our databases which see low change rates but high number of requests.  

This cache will apply to endpoints of the Authentication API and will not impact the Management API.

The following will be cached and updated every thirty (30) seconds:
- General and advanced tenant configuration
- UL Configuration including branding 

Though the behavior changes will be minimal, a follow-on effort will be made to reduce the impacts caching may have on the tenant administration experience.

                   <title>Organizations: Support for SAML Apps</title>
                   <pubDate>Wed, 18 Aug 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate>
                   <description>
Applications that authenticate users via SAML can now use [Auth0 Organizations](https://auth0.com/docs/organizations) to support their business customers and partners.

When [Auth0 is acting as a SAML IdP](https://auth0.com/docs/protocols/saml-protocol#saml-identity-providers), applications can now send users to Auth0 along with an organization ID, and they will be prompted to log-in in the context of that Organization. If no organization is provided, and the application is configured to require one, the user will be prompted to enter the name of the organization they’d like to authenticate with. After logging in, the SAML response will contain the associated Organization ID.

Note that Organizations already supports federating users from your business customers’ organizations into your applications via SAML, by creating [SAML Enterprise Connections](https://auth0.com/docs/connections/enterprise/saml) and [enabling them for your organizations](https://auth0.com/docs/organizations/enable-connections). This update allows applications to trigger Organization login flows using SAML Authentication requests.

Check out [our technical documentation](https://auth0.com/docs/organizations) to learn more about Organizations features and how they can be used to support SaaS and business-to-business applications.

You can learn more about Auth0 support for SAML in [this blog post](https://auth0.com/blog/how-saml-authentication-works/).

                   <description>The [Auth0 CLI](https://github.com/auth0/auth0-cli) lets you build, test, troubleshoot and manage your Auth0 tenants directly from the command line.

If you are using the New Universal Login experience, you can take advantage of the CLI to easily customize the page templates.

When you run:

    auth0 branding templates update

The CLI will open two windows:

- A browser window with a Storybook that shows the login page with the page template applied:

![Page Templates Storybook](//images.contentful.com/kbkgmx9upatd/p7KM9w5fPQ5R7CatmXxXF/d435cfc7bf4150747819dff160696d34/templates-storybook.png)

- Your default editor, with the page template code:

You can now change the page template code, and you will be able to preview the changes in the browser window.

Once you close the window, you’ll be asked if you want to save the template. If you answer Yes, the template will be uploaded to your tenant.

                   <pubDate>Mon, 05 Jul 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate>
                   <description>As part of our continuing work to improve compliance of the New Universal Login flow with accessibility standards, we have made a few improvements in the UI.

### Error Messages
Error messages were not properly communicated to assistive technology users, resulting in users being unable to identify them. To address this issue, we have enhanced our forms to link the error messages with the field that has the error:

In the previous version, we displayed all errors in the form together, below the fields. In order to connect each message to a specific field, we are linking the label to the affected field and updating the visual style:
![signup](https://cdn.auth0.com/blog/dashboard-notifications/eye.png)

 ### Focus Improvements
The focus indicators for Links were also difficult to detect. We updated the style to make it more visible:
![focus](https://cdn.auth0.com/blog/dashboard-notifications/focus.png)

Additionally, it was not possible to set the focus on the ‘Show Password&amp;apos; icon by using the keyboard. We have changed that functionality and it is now possible, with an updated focus style:
![eye](https://cdn.auth0.com/blog/dashboard-notifications/eye.png)

### Link Styles
Since everyone does not have the same abilities to distinguish between colors, color should not be used as the sole visual means of conveying information. In order to make links more accessible, we have increased the font weight in addition to changing the link text color:

                   <pubDate>Mon, 14 Jun 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate>
                   <description>WebAuthn with Security Keys and WebAuthn with Device Biometrics are supported as new multi-factor authentication methods to log in to our management Dashboard, in addition to the existing Guardian, OTP, and SMS factors. 

WebAuthn combines maximum security with a low-friction user experience. We encourage you to add another layer of protection to your account by enabling them in your [Account Settings page](https://manage.auth0.com/#/profile).

                   <title>Auth0 Deploy CLI 7.0.0 is now released</title>
                   <pubDate>Mon, 14 Jun 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate>
                   <description>
Auth0 supports continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) of Auth0 Tenants and integration into existing CI/CD pipelines by using the auth0-deploy-cli tool, which supports the importing and exporting of Auth0 Tenant configuration data.

The [auth0-deploy-cli 7.0.0](https://github.com/auth0/auth0-deploy-cli/releases/tag/v7.0.0) update has now been released.

Added
- MFA Support Recovery Codes

                   <title>Recovery Codes can now be disabled for Multi-factor Authentication</title>
                   <pubDate>Mon, 07 Jun 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate>
                   <description>To allow users continued access to their account in the event that they lose access to their primary multi-factor authentication (MFA) method, Auth0 provides a *Recovery Code* flow that is presented after the user enrolls in MFA.

Depending on the application and how tech savvy end-users are, this adds significant friction. It also does not resolve the issue since most users often do not have access to those recovery codes, when they need them most.

To simplify MFA adoption for applications, Auth0 now treats Recovery Codes as any other authentication method, which can be enabled or disabled. When disabled, end users will not be asked to enroll a Recovery Code, and will not be able to authenticate with one.

Recovery Codes will be enabled for existing tenants that are using MFA but will be disabled, by default, in new tenants. Tenant admins can change this option in the [Multi-factor Authentication configuration screen](https://manage.auth0.com/#/security/mfa).

You can learn more about this in [our documentation](https://auth0.com/docs/mfa/configure-recovery-codes-for-mfa).</description>

                   <pubDate>Wed, 02 Jun 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate>
                   <description>The Dashboard Activity page has been reimagined and now provides tenants with access to data and charts that give them a high-level understanding of their tenant data.

Initially, Tenants will be able to track metrics over time such as Active Users, Sign-ups, and Retention in addition to Failed logins. Auth0 will consistently add additional functionality and features to improve the user experience.

This feature will be available to all US tenants gradually as part of a First Availability rollout. We plan on rolling the update out to the remaining regions over the coming months. Customers will receive a notification when it becomes available in their particular region.

You can learn more in our [public docs](https://auth0.com/docs/get-started/dashboard/activity).

                   <title>Passwordless with WebAuthn Biometrics is Generally Available</title>
                   <pubDate>Fri, 28 May 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate>
                   <description>Auth0 now supports using WebAuthn with Device Biometrics as the first authentication factor. You can enable it from a new Authentication Profile (https://manage.auth0.com/#/authentication-profiles) page in the Auth0 dashboard.

Once enabled, users will be given the option to enroll with WebAuthn after entering their password, if they are logging in from a [WebAuthn-capable device](https://webauthn.me/browser-support). The image below shows the flow for iOS 14+:

![enrollment](https://cdn.auth0.com/blog/dashboard-notifications/passwordless-webauthn-enrollment.png)

The next time they login from that device, they will be asked to use their device biometrics by default:

![challenge](https://cdn.auth0.com/blog/dashboard-notifications/passwordless-webauthn-challenge.png)

Users will go through this flow each time they login for the first time in a new device. We call this feature Progressive Enrollment, and it will help many consumers and corporate employees which already possess devices with built-in biometrics for identification, to get a more convenient login experience while improving security at the same time.

Learn more about how to configure it [here](https://auth0.com/docs/universal-login/configure-universal-login-with-passwordless/webauthn-device-biometrics).

                   <description>Important Notice: although it is not a supported Auth0 product, we are publishing guidance about Sharelock End of Life as a public service announcement.

[Sharelock.io](http://sharelock.io/) service is being ended and the site will be shut down August 1st, 2021. After this date Sharelock will no longer be available, and you will not be able to retrieve any shared secrets that are stored only in Sharelock.

- If you are creating a new shared secret via Sharelock you should plan to move to other alternatives such as [1Password](https://1password.com) and [SendSafely](https://sendsafely.com/) immediately. Creation of Sharelock secrets will no longer be available after June 9th, 2021.
- If you’re retrieving a secret shared with you via Sharelock, you should store this secret in another secure location so you do not lose access to it after August 1st, 2021.</description>

- Draft Mode
- Version Control
- Testing before deploying to prod
- Improved secret management
- Expanded list of supported NPM modules to over 1MM
- Unified programming model across all triggers
- Improved logging

We encourage you to get started with Actions today and provide feedback and questions to us through our [community channel](https://community.auth0.com/c/actions/91). We will continuously build new functionality and extending new elements of the Auth0 pipeline through Actions. We have also updated our [documentation pages](http://www.auth0.com/docs/actions/triggers) to help building and migrating to Actions easy.</description>

                   <description>### Updated Actions Programming Model
We’ve updated the Actions programming model with improvements including consistency between different triggers. This update affects how you write your Actions code going forward. Your existing Actions will continue to execute without any changes. New Actions you create will use the updated version of the programming model. 

### New Features to Actions
We’ve also made improvements to the public API, allowing you to better discover the data model for triggers and we have improved the logging experience for Action executions. You can reference our [documentation](http://www.auth0.com/docs/actions/triggers) for more details about the changes we’ve made, and find sample code for common use cases.</description>

                   <description>When you authenticate with Google Workspace, Google always returns an access_token. 

If you add `access_type=offline&amp;amp;approval_prompt=force` to the authentication request, Auth0 forwards those parameters to Google, and Google also returns an refresh_token. 

We always stored the access_token in the user’s identity, which customers could use to all Google’s APIs. However, we did not store the refresh_token. We changed the behavior and also store the refresh_token when returned by Google.

                   <description>Organizations is a broad update to the Auth0 platform that improves support for Auth0 customers that build and maintain business-to-business and software-as-a-service applications. 

![Organizations Overview Image](//images.ctfassets.net/kbkgmx9upatd/4KUJY7hphYT0L82RJraHja/17041ad50218a941bd92c417cb559b56/asset-community-variant-2-rounded.png)

Auth0 customers on our Enterprise and Startup subscription plans can now:

- Represent the teams, business customers, and partners that use their applications as _organizations_ in Auth0
- Set up branded, federated login flows for each organization
- Manage organization members in a variety of ways, including just-in-time membership and email invitations
- Define roles to represent what end-users can do in their applications and assign those roles to organization members, so they can have different roles in different orgs
- Build administration capabilities into their products so that administrators in those organizations can manage their own membership and access levels

To learn more, have a look at the [announcement blog post](https://auth0.com/blog/introducing-auth0-organizations/) and [technical documentation](https://www.auth0.com/docs/organizations).

                   <description>We&amp;apos;ve released a new user experience for managing tenant members, and a set of new [dashboard roles](https://auth0.com/docs/dashboard-access/feature-access-by-role) (available to enterprise plans) that cover a wider range of collaboration use cases.

As part of this initiative, Auth0 is removing the Application Admin dashboard role, that allowed Admins to invite collaborators to the Auth0 dashboard with access to selected applications, as well as users and connections. 

The Application Admin role is no longer available for inviting new tenant members. Existing Application Admins will be able to keep their role until **September 30, 2021**. Refer to the [migration guide](https://auth0.com/docs/product-lifecycle/deprecations-and-migrations/migrate-tenant-member-roles) for more details.</description>

                   <description>Today we&amp;apos;re releasing the new version of our Management Dashboard navigation and layout after 3 months available as an opt-in experience. This experience improves our side and top navigation and takes advantage of our customer&amp;apos;s screen real estate by adding a flexible layout and a collapsible sidebar.  

The experience will be enabled as the default experience for all new tenants and existing tenants that didn&amp;apos;t explicitly opted out in the past. 
Tenant admins will be able to switch back to the legacy experience until May 2021 via the Feature Previews section in Tenant Settings.

                   <description>Beginning 10 May 2021, the public cloud Auth0 network edge will no longer accept TLS 1.0 or TLS 1.1 traffic.  These legacy protocols are insecure, with well-known weaknesses and vulnerabilities within the industry.  For maximum security, all Auth0 clients must upgrade to TLS 1.2 or later. The exact details and steps required will vary, depending on your application. For further details, see [Upgrade to TLS 1.2, what action to take?](https://community.auth0.com/t/upgrade-to-tls-1-2-what-actions-to-take/56547) posted in Auth0 Community.

                   <pubDate>Wed, 03 Mar 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate>
                   <description>We understand how critical Auth0’s services are for the success of your business. To support that and ensure end-users always have the ability to access your applications, we are excited to announce that we have updated our availability SLA to 99.99% across all Auth0 environments.

The 99.99% availability guarantee applies to all enterprise production Auth0 tenants which means you can expect no more than 4 minutes of downtime for them per month. This is a significant improvement over our previous Public Cloud availability SLA of 99.90% which allowed for nearly 44 minutes of downtime per month. More details on the updated SLA can be reviewed in Auth0’s Service Level Description published at [https://auth0.com/legal](https://auth0.com/legal).

We continue to invest in improving the resilience of its platform and the reliability of its application services. Visit [https://status.auth0.com/](https://status.auth0.com/) at any time to check the status of our platform.</description>

We are replacing our deploy extensions with improved guides for a better developer  experience. Deploy extensions were built at a time before automated code deployment services from web-based DevOps tools. With the advent of Gitlab Pipelines, Github Actions, Bitbucket Pipelines, and Azure Pipelines, the extensions we provide through the Auth0 Extensions Gallery are now obsolete in a world of automated CI/CD pipelines provided by SaaS partners.

For developers who have already installed and configured these extensions, the services and solutions provided by these extensions will continue to work. For developers looking to employ the functionality previously provided through these extensions, we have created a series of guides available in the Auth0 Marketplace that provide a more custom and improved experience than the extensions provided.

[GitLab Pipelines](https://marketplace.auth0.com/integrations/gitlab-pipeline &amp;quot;Auth0 Marketplace Gitlab Pipeline&amp;quot;)

[Github Actions](https://marketplace.auth0.com/integrations/github-actions &amp;quot;Auth0 Marketplace Github Actions&amp;quot;)

[Bitbucket Pipelines](https://marketplace.auth0.com/integrations/bitbucket-pipeline &amp;quot;Auth0 Marketplace Bitbucket Pipeline&amp;quot;)

[Microsoft Azure Pipelines](https://marketplace.auth0.com/integrations/azure-pipeline &amp;quot;Auth0 Marketplace Microsoft Azure Pipelines&amp;quot;)

With the Deploy CLI Extension, we received feedback from many customers that as our product evolved, the extension provided unnecessary additional friction to use the Deploy CLI. The Deploy Extension was intended to be a quick solution to creating an application in your dashboard to quickly connect your external Deploy CLI with your Auth0 instance, however, as the Deploy CLI evolved, so did the need for more customization in how the service connected. The functionality formerly found through the extension will now be served through the [Deploy CLI installation guide](https://auth0.com/docs/extensions/deploy-cli-tool/create-and-configure-the-deploy-cli-application-manually &amp;quot;Auth0 Deploy CLI Guide&amp;quot;). As always, be sure to regularly check the Auth0 Marketplace for all the ways you can use integrations to improve your Auth0 experience.</description>

                   <title>Improvements on the user.multifactor property behavior</title>
                   <pubDate>Fri, 05 Feb 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate>
                   <description>Auth0&amp;apos;s user profile has a property called `user.multifactor`, which was supposed to let you know if the user was enrolled in MFA or not.

In the past, we only set the property the first time the user completed the MFA challenge, but not when the user enrolled or when MFA was reset.

This behavior was fixed, and now the property is always up to date. You can reliably use it to know of the user is enrolled in MFA.</description>

                   <title>Decouple Grant Revocation from Refresh Token Revocation</title>
                   <pubDate>Fri, 05 Feb 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate>
                   <description>A grant provides an application access to a resource on another entity without exposing user credentials. Tokens are issued in the context of a grant, and when a grant is revoked, so do all tokens issued in the context of that grant. When, on the other hand, a token is revoked, this does not necessarily mean that the grant is revoked.

This feature allows the customer to decouple the revocation of refresh token from the revocation of the grant. When this feature is turned on, a refresh token revocation will result in the revocation of the grant that the token is associated with. If, on the other hand, the feature is turned off, then a refresh token revocation will keep the grant intact. 

For existing tenants, this feature is turned on by default to preserve the existing behavior. For new tenants, this feature is turned off by default to make sure that a revocation of a refresh token will not revoke the grant. If a grant revocation is needed, a separate request must be sent using an existing grant revocation endpoint.

For more information, refer to the following documentation: [Refresh token and grants](https://auth0.com/docs/tokens/refresh-tokens/revoke-refresh-tokens#refresh-tokens-and-grants)

                   <title>Improved Dashboard&amp;apos;s Role Based Access Control</title>
                   <pubDate>Wed, 03 Feb 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate>
                   <description>New built-in roles for dashboard members with limited privileges are generally available under enterprise plans, for improved access control. 

The new roles include:

- __Admin__: Read and write access to all resources in the dashboard.
- __Editor - Specific Apps__: Read and write access to specific applications only.
- __Editor - Connections__: Read, write, and create access to all types of connections.
- __Editor - Users__: User Management operations (create, delete, block, unblock, reset MFA, reset password, update metadata, assign roles, etc.) and access to logs.
- __Viewer - Users__: Read-only access to users and logs
- __Viewer - Config__: Read-only access to all configuration settings (applications, APIs, rules, security settings, etc.), except for sensitive information such as secrets, billings, users, and logs.

Tenant members with limited privileges will see only the dashboard’s sections and actions that their respective roles support. They won&amp;apos;t be able to see the tenant members section nor invite other members. 

You can read more about the specific permissions for each role in the [Auth0 documentation](https://auth0.com/docs/dashboard-access/dashboard-roles/feature-access-by-role).</description>

                   <description>In order to improve security and prevent leaks, we have stopped displaying connections and MFA secrets in the Auth0 Dashboard after the configuration is saved. 

This change includes secrets from:

- Enterprise connections
- Social connections
- Passwordless connections 
- Multi-factor authentication providers</description>

                   <pubDate>Thu, 14 Jan 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate>
                   <description># Update to POST/api/v2/tickets/password-change 
With a optional `client_id` parameter, you can now generate password reset tickets to enable a &amp;quot;Back to &amp;lt;app name&amp;gt;&amp;quot; button with application specific redirect behaviors using New Universal Login.

  ![Client ID in password reset tickets for new universal login](//images.ctfassets.net/kbkgmx9upatd/4zh7kjbJvr6cj1XSQIJ6LZ/405fad4eabf2cf4ccaecf464b1831656/Client_id_redirect_for_password_change_tickets.png)

[POST/api/v2/tickets/password-change](https://auth0.com/docs/api/management/v2/#!/Tickets/post_password_change)

`client_id` is an optional parameter that is the ID of the application. If provided for tenants using New Universal Login experience, the user will be prompted to redirect to the default login route of the corresponding application once the ticket is used. See [Configuring Default Login Routes for more details](https://auth0.com/docs/universal-login/configure-default-login-routes#completing-the-password-reset-flow).

                   <description>We changed the layout of the Login page for the New Universal Login Experience. 

The Sign Up link is now rendered below the Continue button, instead of at the bottom of the page. The image below shows the previous an the current default login page:

To keep the rest of the pages consistent, we removed the footer section in all of them, and the links that were displayed in that section are now below the rest of the content.

                   <pubDate>Wed, 16 Dec 2020 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate>
                   <description>Auth0 is excited to announce general availability of a new public cloud environment in Japan. The Auth0 Japan environment joins the US, EU and Australia environments previously available, enabling our customers to offer lower login latencies to their users within Japan and in neighboring countries. 

Auth0 customers can specify their preferred location by simply choosing the Japan region during the tenant creation process. The new Auth0 tenant created will have the `&amp;lt;tenant&amp;gt;.jp.auth0.com` domain name, and will enable customers to comply with legislation governing data regulation, privacy and consumer law.

                   <title>Refresh Token Expiration</title>
                   <pubDate>Tue, 15 Dec 2020 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate>
                   <description>Auth0 is proud to introduce Refresh Token Expiration, which includes two methods of expiring Refresh Tokens to balance security with usability: Absolute Expiration, and Inactivity Expiration. 

Absolute Expiration: When enabled, you can configure the absolute lifetime for refresh tokens, after which, the end-user must re-authenticate before being issued a new refresh token. When disabled, the absolute lifetime will be indefinite.

Inactivity Expiration: When enabled, you can configure the inactivity lifetime for refresh tokens, which expires the refresh token if the user is not active in the application during the inactivity lifetime period.

Using a combination of Inactivity Expiration with Absolute Expiration, you can easily configure shorter lifetimes for more secure applications, or create an experience for end-users whereby they have seemingly indefinite sessions as long as they are active regularly in your application.

In addition, updated default settings for Refresh Tokens are applied to all new applications. To learn more about this capability, see our product documentation: https://auth0.com/docs/tokens/refresh-tokens/configure-refresh-token-expiration.</description>

                   <description>Auth0 has released [Adaptive MFA](https://auth0.com/docs/mfa/adaptive-mfa &amp;quot;Adaptive MFA Documentation&amp;quot;), a new feature within the Multi-factor Authentication offering.   Adaptive MFA allows customers to trigger Multi-factor Authentication based on a series of contextual risk scores, such as whether the user is signing in from an unknown device, or whether the user login is evidencing an impossible travel situation, or whether the user login happens from a risky IP.   The feature also allows customers to access risk assessments in rules, which can be used to write custom business logic to trigger MFA.</description>

                   <description>Starting November 19th, 2020 we now expose IPv6 addresses in our public endpoints e.g. acme.us.auth0.com. If a client request arrives at this endpoint from a machine which supports IPv6, then context.request.ip will show an IPv6 address. If you&amp;apos;re currently perdforming ip address manipulation or checking manually, we encourage you to use [`ipaddr.js@1.9.0`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ipaddr.js/v/1.1.0) which is already available by default in Rules, Hooks, and the Actions Beta.</description>

                   <description>Auth0 provides an API to [generate MFA Enrollment Tickets](https://auth0.com/docs/mfa/auth0-guardian/create-custom-enrollment-tickets). The API generates a URL, which can be sent to end-users by email. Once users navigate to the URL, they are asked to enroll to MFA.

In the past, the MFA enrollment page was rendered using the [Classic Universal Login Experience](https://auth0.com/docs/universal-login/classic-experience) even if [New Universal Login Experience](https://auth0.com/docs/universal-login/new-experience) was enabled. The behavior was changed, and the enrollment page will be displayed with the selected login experience.

                   <description>Dashboard Admins that opt-in to enable MFA for accessing the Auth0 Dashboard with an extra layer of security can now enroll additional factors as well as regenerate recovery codes to prevent being locked out of their account in case they lose their primary device.

The MFA settins for Dashboard users can be configured in the [Profile Page](https://manage.auth0.com/#/profile). Learn more by reading our [docs](https://auth0.com/docs/get-started/dashboard/manage-dashboard-users#add-change-or-remove-mfa).

Adding one or two phone numbers for SMS in addition to Push or OTP factors, as well as storing the backup code, is strongly recommended to prevent losing access to your account.

                   <title>Management APIv2 now supports email verification on all connection types</title>
                   <pubDate>Thu, 10 Sep 2020 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate>
                   <description>Auth0’s Management APIv2 now provides a means to validate emails from users logging in _using any connection_.

**What changed?**

We added the option to specify a user identity when calling the following endpoints:

**POST /api/v2/jobs/verification-email**

[https://auth0.com/docs/api/management/v2#!/Jobs/post_verification_email](https://auth0.com/docs/api/management/v2#!/Jobs/post_verification_email)

This jobs endpoint can be used when you want to leverage Auth0’s email templates to initiate an email verification flow. A new (optional) **identity** field can be specified in the payload. When specified, this will allow an email job to be created for a specific user identity within a user. The **identity** must include a **provider** and **user_id**.

**POST /api/v2/tickets/email-verification**

[https://auth0.com/docs/api/management/v2#!/Tickets/post_email_verification](https://auth0.com/docs/api/management/v2#!/Tickets/post_email_verification)

If you prefer to leverage your own email capabilities, you can use this tickets endpoint to generate an email verification link to use in your custom flows. A new (optional) **identity** object field can be added to the payload. When specified, this will allow a ticket to be created for a specific user identity within a user. The **identity** must include a provider and **user_id**.

By doing this, you can select a secondary, federated, or passwordless-email identity to be verified. Once the user verifies their email using Auth0, the `email_verified` flag associated with the provided identity will be set to `true`. Subsequent logins using a federated identity will not overwrite this value. If the identity being verified happens to be the primary identity of the user, the `email_verified` at the root of the user profile will also be set to true.

**How does this affect me?**

You can take advantage of this capability right away. If you choose not to specify an identity when initiating an email verification flow, no behavior will change. We will continue to only allow for verification of the primary identity of users belonging to the Auth0 IDP. 

**To explore these new capabilities, get started at: [Email Verified Usage](https://auth0.com/docs/users/guides/email-verified) or explore the [APIs ](https://auth0.com/docs/api/management/v2)**</description>

                   <description>Auth0 added limited support for wildcard use in Allowed Web Origins application URLs to make it easier for subscribers to test applications in CI/CD scenarios. Auth0 does not recommend using wildcards in application URLs for production applications; the [OAuth BCP](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-oauth-security-topics-14#page-11)  states that exact URL matching is the safest approach.

                   <title>Expanded Support for Importing Password Hashes</title>
                   <pubDate>Thu, 27 Feb 2020 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate>
                   <description>Accelerate user migration with an enhanced bulk user import with expanded support for common password hashes.

Auth0 enhanced bulk user import with expanded support for common password hashes.  Auth0 now supports importing user passwords hashed with the following algorithms: Argon2, bcrypt (now supports custom number of salt rounds), HMAC, MD4, LDAP, MD5, PBKDF2, SHA1, SHA256, and SHA512. 

This enables you to import users to Auth0 from legacy systems without requiring end-users to reset their passwords. The new custom password object supports a wide array of parameters as well as the ability to upsert (or update) for subsequent import jobs. 

To get started go to [Bulk User Imports](https://auth0.com/docs/users/guides/bulk-user-imports). Want to check if we support the hashing algorithm you use? Go to [Bulk User Import Database Schema and Example](https://auth0.com/docs/users/references/bulk-import-database-schema-examples) for details on the specific hash algorithms, parameters, and encodings we support.

                   <description>Auth0 has made the following security enhancements to one-time-passcodes (OTP) for  passwordless connections:   

 
 -  We will only accept the most current unused one-time password (or link) issued; any previous OTPs will expire once a new OTP is issued. - Users have three attempts to input the correct one-time password; any additional attempts will require a new OTP request. - OTPs for new passwordless connections are valid (by default) for three minutes before expiration. This time can be altered in the connection settings in the [dashboard](https://manage.auth0.com/).

                   <description>Auth0 now enables application developers to easily integrate Sign in with Apple on both Native Apps and Web applications. SIWA for native applications is a new capability that uses an entirely native flow (the user is not required to log in using a browser; the entire exchange takes place natively) that includes an updated iOS SDK for iOS13, a [new QuickStart](https://auth0.com/docs/quickstart/native/ios-swift-siwa), configuration via the Auth0 Admin, and [updated documentation](https://auth0.com/docs/connections/social/apple). With this new capability, you can offer users a consistent login experience across all your applications using SIWA as a social identity provider. Support for SIWA is available to all customers effective today. Read more [here](https://auth0.com/blog/learn-how-to-implement-sign-in-with-apple-easily/).</description>

                   <pubDate>Tue, 30 Jul 2019 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate>
                   <description>Auth0 enhanced [Bulk User Import](https://auth0.com/docs/users/guides/bulk-user-imports) to support bulk updating [select user attributes](https://auth0.com/docs/users/references/user-profile-structure#user-profile-attributes) using the upsert parameter. The upsert parameter can be either set to “true” or “false” during bulk user import and it impacts “pre-existing” users in Auth0. When using bulk user import for the first time you would not bother with upsert since it is only meant to update existing records. However, if you want to run an import again on existing users (by appending more users or upserting fields on existing users), the upsert parameter may be useful. You can use this to do things like update name values from marital status changes or add pictures.  


If upsert parameter is set to `false (default value)` during a bulk user import, pre-existing users that match on email address will not be updated. When set to `true`, pre-existing users that match on email address will be updated, but only with upsertable attributes. *Note: Prior to this release, if you used the upsert parameter and did not specify values for app_metadata, user_metadata or email_verified, those attributes would be replaced with null values.* With this update, upsert will not replace those attributes will null values and you can now more efficiently implement bulk user imports for the following select attributes.  




- app_metadata
- email_verified
- given_name
- family_name
- name
- nickname
- picture
- user_metadata


There is no action required by you and you can start taking better advantage of the Bulk User Import capability today. To get started check out the [Bulk User Imports](https://auth0.com/docs/users/guides/bulk-user-imports)  documentation and to see a full list of attributes supported see our [User Profile Attributes](https://auth0.com/docs/users/references/user-profile-structure#user-profile-attributes).  


As with many other changes to our product, this improvement came from feedback from our valued community. So, if you have feedback on how we can continue to make our product better, please let us know through [this form](https://auth0.com/feedback). We&amp;apos;re always listening and it is super easy!</description>

                   <description>Prior to this release when managing users via [Database Connection](https://auth0.com/docs/connections/database), [Bulk User Import](https://auth0.com/docs/users/guides/bulk-user-imports), or [Management API v2](https://auth0.com/docs/api/management/v2) the username field was restricted to alphanumeric characters, “+”, “.”, “_” and “-”. Auth0 added support for “!”, “#”, “$”, “&amp;apos;”, “^”, “`”, “~”, and “@”. In addition, [Auth0 Universal Login](https://auth0.com/docs/universal-login) supports these characters upon username registration to a Database Connection.  


This enhancement simplifies user migration from systems like Microsoft Azure Active Directory or custom databases, where usernames often contain special characters. At Auth0 we are always looking for ways to simplify onboarding and get started faster.  


There are no immediate changes you need to make to your existing setup and you can start taking advantage of this right away. To learn more, please visit our [Adding Username for Database Connections](https://auth0.com/docs/connections/database/require-username) documentation.

                   <description>We enhanced security with a new option in [advanced tenant settings](https://manage.auth0.com/#/tenant) to prevent exposure of registered user information  

 Auth0 has released a security enhancement in your [advanced tenant settings](https://manage.auth0.com/#/tenant) that will help protect against exposure of registered user information. Bad actors may attempt to guess registered usernames or email addresses by reading error response codes such as `user_exists` in the public signup API.  
 ![Image](https://cdn.auth0.com/blog/generic_response_pref/Generic-response-in-public-signup-API.png)
  
 You can set this option in your [advanced tenant settings](https://manage.auth0.com/#/tenant) in the Auth0 dashboard or via the [Management API v2](https://auth0.com/docs/api/management/v2). New tenants will have this option enabled by default. We highly recommend that you take advantage of this option to prevent exposure of personal information.

                   <description>We&amp;apos;ve enhanced the platform by adding support for the OAuth 2.0 Device Authorization Grant (Device Flow). Device flow enables end-users to authorize input-constrained devices with Internet connectivity (http) to access protected resources such as streaming media, online services, or account information. Examples of input constrained devices include, but are not limited to Smart TVs, Media Players (AppleTV, Roku), some consumer IoT devices, and CLI applications with no access to a browser or graphical shell. For detailed information, please see the [documentation](https://auth0.com/docs/flows/concepts/device-auth) and the [tutorial](https://auth0.com/docs/flows/guides/device-auth/call-api-device-auth). You can also have a hands-on experience using the [Device Flow Playground](https://auth0.github.io/device-flow-playground), which enables you to experience the flow using your own tenant without having to write any code.</description>

                   <description>We&amp;apos;ve have added roles and permissions to the core capabilities of Auth0.  In authorization, a user or application is granted access to an API after the API determines the extent of the permissions that it should assign. Usually, authorization occurs after identity is successfully validated through authentication so that the API has some idea of what sort of access it should grant.  

More information is available in the updated [documentation](https://auth0.com/docs/authorization).</description>

                   <description>We&amp;apos;ve enhanced Auth0 rules so that they can now leverage the MFA context stored in the user session to trigger or suppress MFA prompts in conjunction with silent authentication.  

Many organizations want to use silent authentication in conjunction with MFA whereby the end-user is prompted for MFA during the initial authentication, but not prompted for MFA when renewing tokens during the session lifetime. With MFA context now available in rules, you can check to see if MFA was previously completed (and when), thereby enabling a superior and secure MFA + silent authentication experience for end-users.  

More information is available in the updated [documentation](https://auth0.com/docs/rules/references/context-object), the sample rule available in the [Auth0 dashboard](https://manage.auth0.com/#/rules/create), and in the [Auth0 Support Center](https://support.auth0.com/notifications/5c88930bb69adf000bded51c)</description>

                   <description>We’ve updated our ticketing backend system in order to provide a better support experience to our customers. Although this is an internal migration, you may notice some minor changes in [Support Center](https://support.auth0.com):
- We&amp;apos;ve changed the numbering scheme of the support tickets and they are now 8 digits long.- We assigned new IDs to the existing tickets, which may affect any email notification related to your open tickets. You will still be able to find your existing tickets by their original ID in the Support Center&amp;apos;s [Tickets List](https://support.auth0.com/tickets) page.- Any link to an existing ticket in Support Center will continue to work and will redirect you to the new URL.- We’ve renamed the `open` ticket status to `in progress`.- We’ve renamed the `solved` ticket status to `resolved`.- We’ve renamed the `hold` ticket status to `customer hold`.- We’ve added a new `with sustainment` status to provide visibility whenever the Auth0 Sustainment Engineering team is working on your case.- The attachments that you may add to tickets and comments will be effectively uploaded **after** you submit the ticket or comment. Any error that may occur during the upload will require you to retry the upload by submitting a new comment.- When selecting a file to upload we now validate its size is less than 15Mb, it doesn’t contain invalid characters in its name and it has at least one of the following extensions: `bmp, csv, doc, docx, gz, gif, har, jpg, jpeg, json, mp4, mov, pages, pdf, png, ppt, pptx, rar, tar, tiff, tif, txt, xls, xlsx, xml, zip, htm, html`.- We now show **Auth0 Developer Support** as signature of any comment coming from the Auth0 Support Team, instead of showing the agent&amp;apos;s name.
  

If you have any feedback, it will be welcomed in our [Feedback page](https://auth0.com/feedback).</description>

                   <pubDate>Wed, 03 Oct 2018 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate>
                   <description>We&amp;apos;ve made password policies more flexible by enabling the minimum length (number of required characters) to be set independently from other complexity options.  

Password policies can now require a greater number of characters (from 1-128) without requiring special or mixed-case characters. A common use-case is implementing pass phrases that have no special character requirements, where end-users can provide a series of words that are easy for them to remember, but difficult for hackers to guess. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) recommends that [password length is a greater indicator of over-all strength](https://auth0.com/blog/dont-pass-on-the-new-nist-password-guidelines/) than requiring numbers and special characters. Using the new minimum password length option, password policies can be configured to leverage extremely strong, high-entropy pass phrases that are easier for end-users to remember.  

More information is available in the updated [documentation](https://auth0.com/docs/connections/database/password-strength) and in the [Support Center](https://support.auth0.com/notifications/5bb51faa6d4855000abbd6ca)&amp;lt;/&amp;gt;</description>

                   <description>Additional connection information available in rule&amp;apos;s context.  

Previously only connection name and strategy were available in the rule’s context object. Now it is also possible to access **connectionID**, **connectionMetadata** and two of the **connectionOptions**, **tenant_domain** and **domain_aliases**, *without* calling Management API to get the connection details. More details on the context schema can be found in the [Rules docs](https://auth0.com/docs/rules/current/context).  

We&amp;apos;ve also updated the [Check user email domain matches domains configured in connection](https://github.com/auth0/rules/blob/master/src/rules/check-domains-against-connection-aliases.js) rule template to make use of these enhancements.&amp;lt;/&amp;gt;</description>

Added Seamless Single Sign-On support by eliminating the unnecessary confirmation dialog for people with an active session.

                   <description>Changed how we count active users.  

Previously we counted each Active User that logged into each client/application in a tenant. If your tenant had App A and App B, and one user logged into both apps, that would count as two Active Users.  

Moving forward we will count per Active User within a tenant and no longer count per client/application. If your tenant has App A and App B and one user logs into both apps, they will be counted as one Active User.  

This is reflected in the Support Center&amp;apos;s [quota](https://support.auth0.com/reports/quota) and [usage](https://support.auth0.com/reports/usage) reports, in the [Auth0 Pricing Page](https://auth0.com/pricing) and the [Management Dashboard Subscriptions Section](https://manage.auth0.com/#/tenant/billing/subscription).

Some methods now use a mix of Cross Origin Authentication and `WebAuth.checkSession` (with Web Origins response mode). Read more about Cross Origin Authentication and how to enable Web Origins [here](https://auth0.com/docs/cross-origin-authentication).

                   <description>Auth0 now supports full Client Credentials flow for API Authorizations. This allows server to server authorization for things like scripts, backend services, daemons, or any app that does not need to operate as a user.  

 Enabling the API section can be done via Account Settings or by adding a new **Non Interactive** Client.  

 The **Application** section in the Auth0 Dashboard has been renamed to **Clients** to clarify the distinction between APIs and Clients.  

 This is the first step we are taking towards more complex API authorization scenarios. Other flows, such as User Consent, will be added in the near future. Please visit our full [documentation](https://auth0.com/docs/api-auth) for detailed information about API Authorization.</description>

 **Password Dictionary**, when enabled, prevents the use of common passwords and allows for setting a custom dictionary with up to 200 entries.  

**Password Personal Data**, when enabled, prevents using personal data in the password, such as the user&amp;apos;s name, parts of the email address, etc...</description>

Up till now, only the last code issued was valid, causing issues when opening the wrong email. This change allows the last 5 codes sent to be valid, but once one is used, the rest are invalidated.</description>

                   <description>New Extension: Authorization Dashboard   


This extension gives you the possibility to manage group memberships for your users.  


##### Group Management
Allows you to create groups with a name and a description. Users can be added and removed from groups. This can happen by opening the group and managing users from there, or by opening the user and manage the user&amp;apos;s group memberships from there.  

![extensions](https://cdn2.auth0.com/content/img/authz-groups-ext.png)
  



##### User Management
Besides managing everything from the group point of view you can also open a user and manage his/her group memberships there but also see the &amp;quot;calculated&amp;quot; group memberships for that user.  

![extensions](https://cdn2.auth0.com/content/img/authz-apps-ext.png)
  



##### Application Access
In Auth0 the application access is very coarse grained. All users in a connection that is enabled for the application are able to access the application. With this extension you are now able to take this a step further. You are able to define that only groups &amp;quot;Fabrikam Management&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Fabrikam Finance&amp;quot; are able to access the &amp;quot;Reporting App&amp;quot; containing reports about the company&amp;apos;s financials.

Values are `none`, `client_secret_post` and `client_secret_basic`. The `none` option is introduced for native applications which can’t store secrets and use **PKCE** (see [https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7636](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7636))</description>
