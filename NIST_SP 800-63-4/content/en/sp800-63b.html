<p>This guideline focuses on the authentication of subjects who interact with government information systems over networks to establish that a given claimant is a subscriber who has been previously authenticated. The result of the authentication process may be used locally by the system performing the authentication or asserted elsewhere in a federated identity system. This document defines technical requirements for each of the three authentication assurance levels. The guidelines are not intended to constrain the development or use of standards outside of this purpose. This publication supersedes NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-63B.</p>

<p><em>This section is informative.</em></p>

<p>Authentication is the process of determining the validity of one or more authenticators used to claim a digital identity by establishing that a subject attempting to access a digital service is in control of the secrets used to authenticate. If return visits are applicable to a service, successful authentication provides reasonable risk-based assurance that the subject accessing the service today is the same as the one who previously accessed the service. One-time services (i.e., the <em>subscriber</em> will only ever access the service once) do not necessarily require persistent digital authentication nor the issuance of authenticators.</p>

<p>The authentication of <em>claimants</em> is central to the process of associating a subscriber with their online activity as recorded in their <em>subscriber account</em>, which is maintained by a <em>credential service provider</em> (CSP). Authentication is performed by verifying that the claimant controls one or more <em>authenticators</em> (called <em>tokens</em> in some earlier editions of SP 800-63) associated with a given subscriber account. The authentication process is conducted by a <em>verifier</em>, which is a role of the CSP or — in federated authentication — of an <em>identity provider</em> (IdP). Upon successful authentication, the verifier asserts the <em>identifier</em> for the subscriber to the <em>relying party</em> (RP). Optionally, the verifier may assert additional <em>attributes</em> to the RP.</p>

<p>This guideline provides recommendations on types of authentication processes, including choices of authenticators, that may be used at various <em>authentication assurance levels</em> (AALs). It also provides recommendations on events that may occur during the lifetime of authenticators, including initial issuance, maintenance, and invalidation in the event of loss or theft of the authenticator.</p>

<p>This guideline applies to the digital authentication of subjects to systems over a network. It also requires that verifiers and RPs participating in authentication protocols be authenticated to claimants to assure the identity of the services with which they are authenticating. It does not address the authentication of a person for physical access (e.g., to a building).</p>

<p>This guideline recognizes that subscribers are responsible for protecting their authentication secrets and not disclosing them to others (e.g., credential sharing). The protections at the various AALs are intended to protect against credential theft and are not intended to protect against willful disclosure of credential secrets by a subscriber. In most cases, there are very few technical controls that can detect and prevent such willful collusion and sharing.</p>

<p>AALs categorize the strength of an authentication transaction. Stronger authentication (i.e., a higher AAL) requires malicious actors to have better capabilities and to expend greater resources to successfully subvert the authentication process. Authentication at higher AALs can effectively reduce the risk of attacks. A high-level summary of the technical requirements for each of the AALs is provided below; see <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63b.html#AAL_SEC4">Sec. 2</a> and <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63b.html#AAL_SEC5">Sec. 3</a> of this document for specific normative requirements.</p>

<p><strong>Authentication Assurance Level 1</strong>: AAL1 provides basic confidence that the claimant controls an authenticator bound to the subscriber account being authenticated. AAL1 requires only single-factor authentication using a wide range of available authentication technologies. However, it is recommended that applications assessed at AAL1 offer multi-factor authentication options. Successful authentication requires the claimant to prove <em>possession and control of the authenticator</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Authentication Assurance Level 2</strong>: AAL2 provides high confidence that the claimant controls one or more authenticators bound to the subscriber account being authenticated. Proof of the possession and control of two distinct <em>authentication factors</em> is required. Applications assessed at AAL2 must offer a <em>phishing-resistant</em> authentication (see <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63b.html#verifimpers">Sec. 3.2.5</a>) option.</p>

<p><strong>Authentication Assurance Level 3</strong>: AAL3 provides very high confidence that the claimant controls one or more authenticators bound to the subscriber account being authenticated. Authentication at AAL3 is based on the proof of possession of a key through the use of a public-key cryptographic protocol. AAL3 authentication requires a phishing-resistant authenticator (see <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63b.html#verifimpers">Sec. 3.2.5</a>) with a non-exportable authentication key (see <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63b.html#export">Sec. 3.2.13</a>). To authenticate at AAL3, claimants are required to prove possession and control of two distinct authentication factors.</p>

<p>When a <em>session</em> has been authenticated at a given AAL and a higher AAL is required, an authentication process may also provide step-up authentication to raise the session’s AAL.</p>

<p><em>This section is normative.</em></p>

<p>To satisfy the requirements of a given AAL and be recognized as a subscriber, a claimant <strong class="normative">SHALL</strong> authenticate to an RP (or IdP, as described in <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63c.html#introduction" latex-href="#ref-SP800-63C">[SP800-63C]</a>) with a process whose strength is equal to or greater than the requirements at that level. The authentication process results in an identifier that uniquely identifies the subscriber each time they authenticate to that RP. The identifier <strong class="normative">MAY</strong> be pseudonymous. Other attributes that identify the subscriber as a unique subject <strong class="normative">MAY</strong> also be provided. Detailed normative requirements for authenticators and verifiers at each AAL are provided in <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63b.html#AAL_SEC5">Sec. 3</a>. See <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63.html#sec5" latex-href="#ref-SP800-63">[SP800-63] Sec. 3</a> for details on how to choose the most appropriate AAL.</p>

<p>Personal information collected during and after identity proofing (see <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63a.html#introduction" latex-href="#ref-SP800-63A">[SP800-63A]</a>) <strong class="normative">MAY</strong> be made available to the subscriber by the digital identity service through the subscriber account. The release or online availability of any personal information by federal agencies requires multi-factor authentication in accordance with <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63b.html#ref-EO13681">[EO13681]</a>. Therefore, federal agencies <strong class="normative">SHALL</strong> select a minimum of AAL2 when personal information is made available online.</p>

<p>At all AALs, indicators of potential fraud, including applicable indicators described in <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63b.html#monitoring">Sec. 5.3</a>, <strong class="normative">MAY</strong> be used to lower the risk of misauthentication. For example, authentication from an unexpected geolocation or IP address block (e.g., a cloud service) might prompt the use of additional risk-based controls. CSPs or verifiers <strong class="normative">SHALL</strong> assess their use of indicators of potential fraud for efficacy and to identify and mitigate potential negative impacts on their user populations. CSPs or verifiers <strong class="normative">SHALL</strong> include fraud indicators in the authentication privacy risk assessment. The use of potential fraud indicators prior to or during the authentication process does not impact or change the AAL of a transaction or substitute for an authentication factor.</p>

<p>Throughout this document, <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63b.html#ref-FIPS140">[FIPS140]</a> requirements are satisfied by security technologies, products, and services that utilize implementations of cryptography validated by the Cryptography Module Validation Program <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63b.html#ref-CMVP">[CMVP]</a>. FIPS 140 requirements at a given AAL are often different for authenticators and verifiers, with more stringent requirements generally applying to verifiers. This is in recognition of the practical limitations on the certification of authenticators as well as the broader scope that is often associated with a security breach at a verifier.</p>

<p>AAL1 provides basic confidence that the claimant controls an authenticator that is bound to the subscriber account. AAL1 requires either single-factor or multi-factor authentication using a wide range of available authentication technologies. Verifiers <strong class="normative">SHOULD</strong> make multi-factor authentication options available at AAL1 and encourage their use.

</h3>

<p>At AAL2, authentication <strong class="normative">SHALL</strong> use either a multi-factor authenticator or a combination of two separate authentication factors. A multi-factor authenticator requires two factors to execute a single authentication event, such as a cryptographically secure device with an integrated biometric sensor that is required to activate the device. Authenticator requirements are specified in <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63b.html#AAL_SEC5">Sec. 3</a>.</p>

<p>When a multi-factor authenticator is used, any of the following <strong class="normative">MAY</strong> be used:</p>

</ul>

<p>When a combination of two single-factor authenticators is used, the combination <strong class="normative">SHALL</strong> include one <em>physical authenticator</em> (i.e., “something you have”) from the following list in conjunction with either a password (<a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63b.html#password">Sec. 3.1.1</a>) or a biometric comparison:</p>

<p>Authenticators used at AAL3 <strong class="normative">SHALL</strong> use approved cryptography. Communication between the claimant and verifier <strong class="normative">SHALL</strong> occur via one or more authenticated protected channels. The cryptographic authenticator used at AAL3 <strong class="normative">SHALL</strong> have a non-exportable private key and <strong class="normative">SHALL</strong> provide phishing resistance, as described in <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63b.html#verifimpers">Sec. 3.2.5</a>. The cryptographic authentication protocol <strong class="normative">SHALL</strong> be replay-resistant, as described in <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63b.html#replay">Sec. 3.2.7</a>. All authentication and reauthentication processes at AAL3 <strong class="normative">SHALL</strong> demonstrate authentication intent from at least one authenticator, as described in <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63b.html#intent">Sec. 3.2.8</a>. Cryptographic authenticators used at AAL3 <strong class="normative">SHALL</strong> use public-key cryptography to protect the authentication secrets from compromise of the verifier.</p>

<p>Single-factor and multi-factor authenticators used at AAL3 <strong class="normative">SHALL</strong> be validated to meet the requirements of <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63b.html#ref-FIPS140">[FIPS140]</a> Level 1 or higher overall. As described in <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63b.html#export">Sec. 3.2.12</a>, cryptographic authenticators used at AAL3 are required to provide a hardware-protected, isolated environment to prevent authentication keys from being leaked or extracted. Since <em>syncable authenticators</em> (described in <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63b.html#appB">Appendix B</a>) require the private key to be exportable, syncable authenticators <strong class="normative">SHALL NOT</strong> be used at AAL3.</p>

<p>If CSPs or IdPs process attributes for purposes other than identity services (i.e., identity proofing, authentication, or attribute <em>assertions</em>), related fraud mitigation, or compliance with laws or legal processes, they <strong class="normative">SHALL</strong> implement measures to maintain predictability and manageability commensurate with the privacy risks that arise from the additional processing. Examples of such measures include providing clear notice, obtaining subscriber consent, and enabling the selective use or disclosure of attributes. When CSPs or IdPs use consent measures, they <strong class="normative">SHALL NOT</strong> make consent for the additional processing a condition of the identity service.</p>

<p><em>This section is normative.</em></p>

<p>This section provides detailed requirements that are specific to each type of authenticator. With the exception of the reauthentication requirements specified in <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63b.html#AAL_SEC4">Sec. 2</a> and the requirement for phishing resistance at AAL3 described in <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63b.html#verifimpers">Sec. 3.2.5</a>, the technical requirements for each authenticator type are the same, regardless of the AAL at which the authenticator is used.</p>

<p>In federated applications described in <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63c.html#introduction" latex-href="#ref-SP800-63C">[SP800-63C]</a>, the authentication functions of an IdP correspond closely with that of a CSP or verifier. In the discussion below, the requirements associated with a CSP also apply to an IdP.</p>

<p>In many circumstances, subscribers need to share devices that are used in authentication processes, such as a family phone that receives OTPs. In public-facing applications, CSPs <strong class="normative">SHOULD NOT</strong> prevent a device from being registered as an authenticator by multiple subscribers. However, they <strong class="normative">MAY</strong> establish restrictions to prevent large-scale fraud or misuse (e.g., limiting the total number of subscriber accounts a single device can be registered with).</p>

<p>Authentication, <em>authenticator binding</em> (discussed in <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63b.html#binding">Sec. 4.1</a>), and session management (discussed in <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63b.html#sessmgmt">Sec. 5</a>) are based on proof of possession of one or more types of secrets, as shown in <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63b.html#table-2">Table 2</a>.</p>

</h3>

<p>A password (sometimes referred to as a <em>passphrase</em> or, if numeric, a <em>personal identification number [PIN]</em>) is a secret value intended to be chosen and either memorized or recorded by the subscriber. Passwords must be of sufficient effective strength and secrecy that it would be impractical for an attacker to guess or otherwise discover the correct secret value. A password is “something you know.”</p>

<p>The requirements in this section apply to centrally verified passwords that are used as independent authentication factors and sent over an authenticated protected channel to the verifier. Passwords used locally as an activation factor for a multi-factor authenticator (e.g., an unlock PIN) are referred to as <em>activation secrets</em> and discussed in <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63b.html#s-5-2-10">Sec. 3.2.10</a>. In contrast to centrally verified passwords, activation secrets (similar to the unlock passwords or PINs on many devices) are not sent to the verifier and instead used locally to gain access to the authentication secret.</p>

<p>Passwords are not phishing-resistant.</p>

</h4>

<p>Passwords <strong class="normative">SHALL</strong> either be chosen by the subscriber or assigned randomly by the CSP.</p>

<p>If the CSP disallows a chosen password because it is on a blocklist of commonly used, expected, or compromised values (see <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63b.html#passwordver">Sec. 3.1.1.2</a>), the subscriber <strong class="normative">SHALL</strong> be required to choose a different password. Other composition requirements for passwords <strong class="normative">SHALL NOT</strong> be imposed.

</h4>

<p>The following requirements apply to passwords.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Verifiers and CSPs <strong class="normative">SHALL</strong> require passwords that are used as a single-factor authentication mechanism to be a minimum of 15 characters in length. Verifiers and CSPs <strong class="normative">MAY</strong> allow passwords that are only used as part of multi-factor authentication processes to be shorter but <strong class="normative">SHALL</strong> require them to be a minimum of eight characters in length.</li>
  <li>Verifiers and CSPs <strong class="normative">SHOULD</strong> permit a maximum password length of at least 64 characters.</li>
  <li>Verifiers and CSPs <strong class="normative">SHOULD</strong> accept all printing ASCII <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63b.html#ref-RFC20">[RFC20]</a> characters and the space character in passwords.</li>
  <li>Verifiers and CSPs <strong class="normative">SHOULD</strong> accept Unicode <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63b.html#ref-ISOIEC10646">[ISO/ISC 10646]</a> characters in passwords. Each Unicode code point <strong class="normative">SHALL</strong> be counted as a single character when evaluating password length.</li>
  <li>Verifiers and CSPs <strong class="normative">SHALL NOT</strong> impose other composition rules (e.g., requiring mixtures of different character types) for passwords.</li>
  <li>Verifiers and CSPs <strong class="normative">SHALL NOT</strong> require subscribers to change passwords periodically. However, verifiers <strong class="normative">SHALL</strong> force a change if there is evidence that the authenticator has been compromised.</li>
  <li>Verifiers and CSPs <strong class="normative">SHALL NOT</strong> permit the subscriber to store a hint (e.g., a reminder of how the password was created) that is accessible to an unauthenticated claimant.</li>
  <li>Verifiers and CSPs <strong class="normative">SHALL NOT</strong> prompt subscribers to use knowledge-based authentication (KBA) (e.g., “What was the name of your first pet?”) or security questions when choosing passwords.</li>
  <li>Verifiers <strong class="normative">SHALL</strong> request the password to be provided in full (not a subset of it) and <strong class="normative">SHALL</strong> verify the entire submitted password (e.g., not truncate it).</li>
</ol>

<p>If Unicode characters are accepted in passwords, the verifier <strong class="normative">SHOULD</strong> apply the normalization process for stabilized strings using the Normalization Form Canonical Composition (NFC) normalization defined in Sec. 12.1 of <em>Unicode Normalization Forms</em> <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63b.html#ref-UAX15">[UAX15]</a>. This process is applied before hashing the byte string that represents the password. Subscribers choosing passwords that contain Unicode characters <strong class="normative">SHOULD</strong> be advised that some endpoints may represent some characters differently, which would affect their ability to authenticate successfully.</p>

<p>When processing a request to establish or change a password, verifiers <strong class="normative">SHALL</strong> compare the prospective secret against a blocklist that contains known commonly used, expected, or compromised passwords. The entire password <strong class="normative">SHALL</strong> be subject to comparison, not substrings or words that might be contained therein. For example, the list may include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Passwords obtained from previous breach corpuses</li>
  <li>Dictionary words</li>
  <li>Context-specific words, such as the name of the service, the username, and derivatives thereof</li>
</ul>

<p>If the chosen password is found on the blocklist, the CSP <strong class="normative">SHALL</strong> require the subscriber to select a different secret and <strong class="normative">SHALL</strong> provide the reason for rejection. Since the blocklist is used to defend against brute-force attacks and unsuccessful attempts are rate-limited, the blocklist <strong class="normative">SHOULD</strong> be of sufficient size to prevent subscribers from choosing passwords that attackers are likely to guess before reaching the attempt limit.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Excessively large blocklists are of little incremental security benefit because the blocklist is used to defend against online attacks, which are already limited by the throttling requirements described in <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63b.html#throttle">Sec. 3.2.2</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Verifiers <strong class="normative">SHALL</strong> offer guidance to the subscriber to help the subscriber choose a strong password. This is particularly important following the rejection of a password on the blocklist as it discourages trivial modifications of listed weak passwords <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63b.html#ref-blocklists">[Blocklists]</a>.</p>

<p>Verifiers <strong class="normative">SHALL</strong> allow the use of password managers and autofill functionality. Verifiers <strong class="normative">SHOULD</strong> permit claimants to use the “paste” function when entering a password to facilitate password manager use when password autofill APIs are unavailable.

<p>To help the claimant successfully enter a password, the verifier <strong class="normative">SHOULD</strong> offer an option to display the password — rather than a series of dots or asterisks — while it is entered and until it is submitted to the verifier. This allows the claimant to confirm their entry if they are in a location where their screen is unlikely to be observed. The verifier <strong class="normative">MAY</strong> also permit the claimant’s device to display individual entered characters for a short time after each character is typed to verify the correct entry. This is common on mobile devices.</p>

<p>Verifiers <strong class="normative">MAY</strong> make limited allowances for mistyping (e.g., removing leading and trailing whitespace characters before verification, allowing the verification of passwords with differing cases for the leading character) if the password remains at least the required minimum length after such processing and the complexity of the resulting password is not significantly reduced.</p>

<p>Verifiers and CSPs <strong class="normative">SHALL</strong> use approved encryption and an authenticated protected channel when requesting passwords.</p>

<p>Verifiers <strong class="normative">SHALL</strong> store passwords in a form that is resistant to offline attacks. Passwords <strong class="normative">SHALL</strong> be <em>salted</em> and hashed using a suitable password hashing scheme. Password hashing schemes take a password, a salt, and a cost factor as inputs and generate a password hash. Their purpose is to make each password guess more expensive for an attacker who has obtained a hashed password file, thereby making the cost of a guessing attack high or prohibitive. The chosen cost factor <strong class="normative">SHOULD</strong> be as high as practical without negatively impacting verifier performance. It <strong class="normative">SHOULD</strong> be increased over time to account for increases in computing performance. An approved password hashing scheme published in the latest revision of <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63b.html#ref-SP800-132">[SP800-132]</a> or updated NIST guidelines on password hashing schemes <strong class="normative">SHOULD</strong> be used. The chosen output length of the password verifier, excluding the salt and versioning information, <strong class="normative">SHOULD</strong> be the same as the length of the underlying password hashing scheme output.</p>

<p>The salt <strong class="normative">SHALL</strong> be at least 32 bits in length and chosen to minimize salt value collisions among stored hashes (i.e., to prevent multiple subscriber accounts from having the same hashed password). Both the salt value and the resulting hash <strong class="normative">SHALL</strong> be stored for each password. A reference to the password hashing scheme used, including the cost factor, <strong class="normative">SHOULD</strong> be stored for each password to allow migration to new algorithms and work factors.</p>

<p>In addition, verifiers <strong class="normative">SHOULD</strong> perform an additional iteration of a keyed hashing or encryption operation using a secret key known only to the verifier. If used, this key value <strong class="normative">SHALL</strong> be generated by an approved random bit generator, as described in <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63b.html#randomness">Sec. 3.2.12</a>. The secret key value <strong class="normative">SHALL</strong> be stored separately from the hashed passwords. It <strong class="normative">SHOULD</strong> be stored and used within a hardware-protected area, such as a hardware security module or trusted execution environment (TEE), such as a trusted platform module (TPM). With this additional iteration, brute-force attacks on the hashed passwords are impractical as long as the secret key value remains secret.</p>

</h3>

<p>A look-up secret authenticator is a physical or electronic record that stores a set of secrets shared between the claimant and the CSP. The claimant uses the authenticator to look up the appropriate secrets needed to respond to a prompt from the verifier. For example, the verifier could ask a claimant to provide a specific subset of the numeric or character strings printed on a card in table format. A typical application of look-up secrets is for one-time saved recovery codes (see <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63b.html#savedrecovery">Sec. 4.2.1.1</a>) that the subscriber stores for use if another authenticator is lost or malfunctions.

</h3>

<p>An out-of-band authenticator is a physical device that is uniquely addressable and can communicate securely with the verifier over an independent communications channel, which is referred to as the secondary channel. The device is possessed and controlled by the claimant and supports private communication over this separate secondary channel, which is separate from the primary channel for authentication. An out-of-band authenticator is “something you have.” Examples of out-of-band devices include smartphones equipped with applications that allow the verifier to independently communicate with the subscriber or the use of text messaging or audio calls to communicate with the subscriber.</p>

<p>Out-of-band authentication uses a short-term secret generated by the verifier. The secret securely binds the authentication operation on the primary and secondary channels and establishes the claimant’s control of the out-of-band device.</p>

<p>Out-of-band authentication is not phishing-resistant.</p>

<p>The out-of-band authenticator can operate in one of the following ways:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The claimant transfers a secret received by the out-of-band device via the secondary channel to the verifier using the primary channel. For example, the claimant may receive the secret (typically a 6-digit code) on their mobile device and type it into their authentication session. This method is shown in <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63b.html#fig-1">Fig. 1</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p latex-ignore="true"><a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63b.html#fig-1" name="fig-1">Fig. 1. Transfer of secret to primary device</a></p>

<p><img src="./sp800-63b_files/OOB-example1.png" alt="Diagram showing authentication secret being transferred from out-of-band device to session being authenticated" title="Transfer of secret to primary device" latex-src="OOB-example1.pdf" latex-fig="1" latex-place="pt"></p>

<ul>
  <li>The claimant transfers a secret received via the primary channel to the out-of-band device for transmission to the verifier via the secondary channel. For example, the claimant may view the secret on their authentication session and either type it into an application on their mobile device or use a technology such as a barcode or QR code to effect the transfer. This method is shown in <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63b.html#fig-2">Fig. 2</a>.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Note:</strong> A third method of out-of-band authentication compares the secrets received from the primary and secondary channels and requests approval on the secondary channel. This method is no longer considered acceptable because it increases the likelihood that the subscriber would approve an authentication request without actually comparing the secrets as required. This has been observed with “authentication fatigue” attacks in which an attacker generates many out-of-band authentication requests to the subscriber, who might approve one to eliminate the annoyance. For this reason, these guidelines require the transfer of the secret between the out-of-band device and the primary channel to increase assurance that the subject is actively participating in the session with the verifier. Presenting the claimant with a list of secrets to compare is not sufficient to meet this requirement, as the claimant may reasonably guess the secret due to the limited size of the list that can be presented.</p>

</h4>

<p>The out-of-band authenticator <strong class="normative">SHALL</strong> establish a separate channel with the verifier to retrieve the out-of-band secret or authentication request. This channel is considered to be out-of-band with respect to the primary communication channel (even if it terminates on the same device), provided that the device does not leak information from one channel to the other without the claimant’s participation.</p>

<p>The out-of-band device <strong class="normative">SHOULD</strong> be uniquely addressable by the verifier.

<p>Email <strong class="normative">SHALL NOT</strong> be used for out-of-band authentication because it may be vulnerable to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Access using only a password</li>
  <li>Interception in transit or at intermediate mail servers</li>
  <li>Rerouting attacks, such as those caused by Domain Name System (DNS) spoofing</li>

</blockquote>

<p>The out-of-band authenticator <strong class="normative">SHALL</strong> uniquely authenticate itself in one of the following ways when communicating with the verifier:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Using approved cryptography, establish a mutually authenticated protected channel (e.g., client-authenticated <em>transport layer security</em> (TLS) <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63b.html#ref-RFC8446">[RFC8446]</a>) with the verifier. Communication between the out-of-band authenticator and the verifier <strong class="normative">MAY</strong> use a trusted intermediary service to which each authenticates. The key used to establish the channel <strong class="normative">SHALL</strong> be provisioned in a mutually authenticated session during authenticator binding, as described in <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63b.html#binding">Sec. 4.1</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Authenticate to a public mobile telephone network using a SIM card or equivalent secret that uniquely identifies the subscriber. This method <strong class="normative">SHALL</strong> only be used if a secret is sent from the verifier to the out-of-band device via the PSTN (i.e., SMS or voice) or an encrypted instant messaging service.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Use a wired connection to the PSTN that the verifier can call and dictate the out-of-band secret. For the purposes of this definition, “wired connection” includes services such as cable providers that offer PSTN services through other wired media and fiber via analog telephone adapters.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>For single-factor out-of-band authenticators, if a secret is sent by the verifier to the out-of-band device, the device <strong class="normative">SHOULD NOT</strong> display the authentication secret while it is locked by the owner. Rather, the device <strong class="normative">SHOULD</strong> require the presentation and verification of a PIN, passcode, or biometric characteristic to view the secret. However, authenticators <strong class="normative">SHOULD</strong> indicate the receipt of an authentication secret on a locked device.</p>

<p>If the out-of-band authenticator requests approval over the secondary communication channel rather than by presenting a secret that the claimant transfers to the primary communication channel, it <strong class="normative">SHALL</strong> accept a transfer of the secret from the primary channel and send it to the verifier over the secondary channel to associate the approval with the authentication transaction. The claimant <strong class="normative">MAY</strong> perform the transfer manually or with the assistance of a representation, such as a barcode or quick response (QR) code.</p>

<p>The verifier waits for an authenticated protected channel to be established with the out-of-band authenticator and verifies its identifying key. The verifier <strong class="normative">SHALL NOT</strong> store the identifying key itself but <strong class="normative">SHALL</strong> use a verification method (e.g., an approved hash function or proof of possession of the identifying key) to uniquely identify the authenticator.

  </li>
</ul>

<p>In all cases, the authentication <strong class="normative">SHALL</strong> be considered invalid unless completed within 10 minutes.

<p>The verifier <strong class="normative">SHALL</strong> generate random authentication secrets that are at least six decimal digits (or equivalent) in length using an approved random bit generator as described in <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63b.html#randomness">Sec. 3.2.12</a>.

<p>A single-factor OTP generates one-time passwords (OTPs). This category includes hardware devices and software-based OTP generators that are installed on devices such as mobile phones. These authenticators have an embedded secret that is used as the seed for generating OTPs and do not require activation through a second factor.

A single-factor OTP authenticator is “something you have.”</p>

<p>Single-factor OTPs are similar to look-up secret authenticators except that the secrets are cryptographically and independently generated by the authenticator and the verifier and compared by the verifier. The secret is computed based on a nonce that may be time-based or from a counter on the authenticator and verifier.</p>

<p>OTP authentication is not phishing-resistant. <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63b.html#ref-FIPS140">[FIPS140]</a> validation of OTP authenticators and verifiers is not required.</p>

<p>Single-factor OTP authenticators and verifiers contain two persistent values: 1) a symmetric key that persists for the authenticator’s lifetime and 2) a nonce that is either changed each time the authenticator is used or is based on a real-time clock.</p>

<p>The authenticator output is obtained using an approved block cipher or hash function to securely combine the key and nonce.

<p>A multi-factor OTP generates one-time passwords for authentication following the input of an activation factor. This includes hardware devices and software-based OTP generators that are installed on mobile phones and similar devices. The second authentication factor may be provided through an integral entry pad, an integral biometric (e.g., fingerprint) reader, or a direct computer interface (e.g., universal serial bus [USB] port). The OTP is displayed on the authenticator and manually input for transmission to the verifier. The multi-factor OTP authenticator is “something you have” activated by either “something you know” or “something you are.”</p>

<p>OTP authentication is not phishing-resistant. <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63b.html#ref-FIPS140">[FIPS140]</a> validation of OTP authenticators and verifiers is not required.</p>

<p>Multi-factor OTP authenticators operate similarly to single-factor OTP authenticators (see <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63b.html#sfotpa">Sec. 3.1.4.1</a>), except they require the presentation and verification of an activation factor (i.e., a password or a biometric characteristic) to obtain the OTP from the authenticator.

<p>Biometrics is the automated recognition of individuals based on their biological and behavioral characteristics, such as fingerprints, voice patterns, facial features, keystroke patterns, angle of holding a smart phone, screen pressure, typing speed, mouse movements, or gait. Such characteristics have multiple modalities that may differ in the extent to which they establish authentication intent, as described in <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63b.html#intent">Sec. 3.2.8</a>.</p>

<p>Biometric comparisons are based on a measurement from the biometric sensor (e.g., camera, fingerprint reader). This measurement is subject to noise and presentation variations that require setting an acceptance threshold based on the differences between the measured biometric and the reference against which it is being compared. Due to these factors, there is some probability that a comparison will not result in a match, which is referred to as a false non-match rate (FNMR). Similarly, there is a probability that an impostor comparison will result in a match, referred to as a false match rate (FMR). A high-quality biometric system has both a very low FMR and FNMR. The chosen threshold usually emphasizes a low FMR to maximize security since false non-matches can often be mitigated by repeating the measurement or using an alternative authentication method.</p>

<p>For a variety of reasons, this document supports only a limited use of biometrics for authentication. These reasons include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The biometric FMR does not provide sufficient confidence in the subscriber’s authentication by itself because it does not account for active impersonation attacks.</li>
  <li>Biometric comparison is probabilistic, whereas the other authentication factors are deterministic.</li>
  <li>Biometric template protection schemes provide a method for revoking biometric characteristics that are comparable to other authentication factors (e.g., PKI certificates, passwords). However, the availability of such solutions is limited.</li>
  <li>Biometric characteristics do not constitute secrets. They can often be obtained online or otherwise without consent. A facial image can be obtained by taking a picture; latent fingerprints can be obtained from objects someone touches; and iris patterns can be captured with high-resolution cameras. While presentation attack detection (PAD) technologies can mitigate the risks of these types of attacks, additional trust in the sensor or biometric processing is required to ensure that PAD is operating in accordance with the needs of the CSP and the subscriber.</li>
  <li>The use of biometric characteristics, especially when stored for central verification, introduces new privacy concerns, which are discussed further in <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63b.html#privacy">Sec. 7</a>.</li>

<p>The biometric system <strong class="normative">SHALL</strong> allow no more than five consecutive failed authentication attempts or 10 consecutive failed attempts if PAD is implemented and meets the above requirements.

These limits are upper bounds, and agencies <strong class="normative">MAY</strong> make risk-based decisions to impose lower limits.</p>

<p>The verifier <strong class="normative">SHOULD</strong> determine the performance and integrity of the sensor and its associated endpoint. This increases the likelihood of detecting injection attacks due to compromised endpoints, sensor emulators, and similar threats. Acceptable methods for making this determination include:</p>

</ul>

<p>Biometric comparison can be performed locally on a device being used by the claimant or at a central verifier. Since the potential for attacks on a larger scale is greater at central verifiers, comparison <strong class="normative">SHOULD</strong> be performed locally.</p>

<p>The CSP needs to have a reliable basis for evaluating the characteristics of the authenticator, such as the inclusion of a signed attestation.

    Phishing Resistance <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63b.html#verifimpers" class="header-link"><i class="fa fa-link"></i></a>
  
  
</h3>

<p>Phishing attacks, previously referred to in SP 800-63B as “verifier impersonation,” are attempts by fraudulent verifiers and RPs to fool an unwary claimant into presenting an authenticator to an impostor. In some prior versions of SP 800-63, protocols that are resistant to phishing attacks were also referred to as “strongly MitM-resistant.”</p>

<p>In this document, phishing resistance is the ability of the authentication protocol to prevent the disclosure of authentication secrets and valid authenticator outputs to an impostor verifier (i.e., an attacker fraudulently posing as the verifier) without relying on the vigilance of the claimant. How the claimant is directed to the impostor verifier is not relevant. For example, regardless of whether the claimant was directed there via search engine optimization or prompted by email, it is considered to be a phishing attack.</p>

<p>Approved cryptographic algorithms <strong class="normative">SHALL</strong> be used to establish phishing resistance where required. Keys used for this purpose <strong class="normative">SHALL</strong> provide at least the minimum security strength specified in the latest revision of <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63b.html#ref-SP800-131A">[SP800-131A]</a> (i.e., 112 bits as of the date of this publication).</p>

<p>Phishing resistance requires single- or multi-factor cryptographic authentication. Authenticators that involve the manual entry of an authenticator output (e.g., out-of-band and OTP authenticators) <strong class="normative">SHALL NOT</strong> be considered phishing-resistant because the manual entry does not bind the authenticator output to the specific session being authenticated. For example, an impostor verifier could relay an authenticator output to the verifier and successfully authenticate.</p>

<p>Two methods of phishing resistance are recognized: channel binding and verifier name binding. Channel binding is considered more secure than verifier name binding because it is not vulnerable to the misissuance or misappropriation of verifier certificates, but both methods satisfy the requirements for phishing resistance.</p>
<h4 id="channel-binding" data-section="3">
  
  
    Channel Binding <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63b.html#channel-binding" class="header-link"><i class="fa fa-link"></i></a>
  
  
</h4>

<p>An authentication protocol with channel binding <strong class="normative">SHALL</strong> establish an authenticated protected channel with the verifier. The protocol <strong class="normative">SHALL</strong> then strongly and irreversibly bind a channel identifier negotiated in establishing the authenticated protected channel to the authenticator output (e.g., by signing the two values together using a private key controlled by the claimant for which the public key is known to the verifier). The verifier <strong class="normative">SHALL</strong> validate the signature or other information used to prove phishing resistance. This prevents an impostor verifier — even one that has obtained a certificate that represents the actual verifier — from successfully relaying that authentication on a different authenticated protected channel.</p>

<p>An example of a phishing-resistant authentication protocol that uses channel binding is client-authenticated TLS <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63b.html#ref-RFC8446">[RFC8446]</a> in which the client signs the authenticator output along with earlier messages from the protocol that are unique to the particular TLS connection being negotiated. Personal identity verification (PIV) and common access card (CAC) cards, which use client-authenticated TLS, provide phishing resistance through channel binding.</p>

</h4>

<p>An authentication protocol with verifier name binding <strong class="normative">SHALL</strong> establish an authenticated protected channel with the verifier. The protocol <strong class="normative">SHALL</strong> then generate an authenticator output that is cryptographically bound to a verifier identifier that is authenticated as part of the protocol. In the case of DNS identifiers, the verifier identifier <strong class="normative">SHALL</strong> be either the authenticated hostname of the verifier or a parent domain that is at least one level below the public suffix <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63b.html#ref-psl">[PSL]</a> associated with that hostname. The binding <strong class="normative">MAY</strong> be established by choosing an associated authenticator secret, deriving an authenticator secret using the verifier identifier, cryptographically signing the authenticator output with the verifier identifier, or using similar cryptographically secure means.</p>

<p>WebAuthn <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63b.html#ref-WebAuthn">[WebAuthn]</a>, which is used by authenticators that implement the Fast Identity Online 2 (FIDO2) specifications <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63b.html#ref-FIDO2">[FIDO2]</a>, is an example of a standard that provides phishing resistance through verifier name binding by choosing an authenticator secret based on the authenticated domain name of the verifier.</p>

</h3>

<p>An authentication process resists <em>replay attacks</em> if it is impractical to achieve a successful authentication by recording and replaying a previous authentication message. Replay resistance is in addition to the replay-resistant nature of authenticated protected channel protocols since the output could be stolen before entry into the protected channel. Protocols that use nonces or challenges to prove the “freshness” of the transaction are resistant to replay attacks since the verifier will easily detect when old protocol messages are replayed because they will not contain the appropriate nonces or timeliness data. Examples of replay-resistant authenticators include OTP authenticators, cryptographic authenticators, and look-up secrets.</p>

<p>In contrast, passwords are not considered replay-resistant because the same authenticator output (i.e., the password itself) is provided for each authentication.</p>
<h3 id="intent" data-section="3">

</h3>

<p>An authentication process demonstrates intent if it requires the claimant to respond explicitly to each authentication or reauthentication request. The goal of authentication intent is to make it more difficult for authenticators (e.g., multi-factor cryptographic authenticators) to be used without the claimant’s knowledge, such as by malware on the endpoint. The authenticator itself <strong class="normative">SHALL</strong> establish authentication intent. Multi-factor authenticators <strong class="normative">MAY</strong> establish intent by reentry of the activation factor for the authenticator.</p>

<p>Authentication intent <strong class="normative">MAY</strong> be established in several ways. Authentication processes that require the claimant’s intervention can be used to prove intent (e.g., a claimant entering an authenticator output from an OTP authenticator). Cryptographic authenticators that require claimant action for each authentication or reauthentication operation can also be used to establish intent (e.g., by pushing a button or reinsertion).</p>

<p>The presentation of biometric characteristics does not always establish authentication intent. For example, using a front-facing camera on a mobile phone to capture a face biometric does not necessarily constitute intent, as it can be reasonably expected to capture a face image while the device is used for other non-authentication purposes. In these scenarios, an explicit mechanism (e.g., tapping a software or physical button) <strong class="normative">SHALL</strong> be provided to establish authentication intent.</p>

</h3>

<p>As threats evolve, authenticators’ ability to resist attacks typically degrades. Conversely, the performance of some authenticators may improve, such as when changes to their underlying standards increase their ability to resist particular attacks.</p>

<p>To account for these changes in authenticator performance, NIST places additional restrictions on authenticator types or specific classes or instantiations of an authenticator type. Although they represent a less secure approach to multi-factor authentication, <em>restricted authenticators</em> remain necessary for some government-to-public applications. At the time of publication of these guidelines, there is one restricted authenticator: the use of the PSTN for out-of-band authentication, as described in <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63b.html#pstnOOB">Sec. 3.1.3.3</a>.</p>

<p>The acceptance of a restricted authenticator requires the implementing organization to assess, understand, and accept the risks associated with that authenticator and acknowledge that risks will likely increase over time. It is the RP’s responsibility to determine the level of acceptable risk for their systems and associated data, define any methods for mitigating excessive risks, and communicate those determinations to the verifier. If the RP determines that the risk to any party is unacceptable, the restricted authenticator <strong class="normative">SHALL NOT</strong> be used, and an alternative authenticator type <strong class="normative">SHALL</strong> be used.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the risk of an authentication error is typically borne by multiple parties, including the implementing organization, organizations that rely on the authentication decision, and the subscriber. Because the subscriber may be exposed to additional risks when an organization accepts a restricted authenticator and the subscriber may have a limited understanding of and ability to control those risks, the CSP <strong class="normative">SHALL</strong> do all of the following:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Offer subscribers at least one alternative authenticator that is not restricted and can be used to authenticate at the required AAL</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Provide subscribers with meaningful notice regarding the restricted authenticator’s security risks and the availability of unrestricted alternatives</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Address any additional risks to subscribers and RPs in its risk assessment</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Develop a migration plan for the possibility that the restricted authenticator will not be acceptable in the future and include this migration plan in its Digital Identity Acceptance Statement (see <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63.html#IDacceptStmt" latex-href="#ref-SP800-63">Sec. 3.4.4 of [SP800-63]</a>)</p>

<p>A password used locally as an activation factor for a multi-factor authenticator is referred to as an <em>activation secret</em>. An activation secret is used to obtain access to a stored authentication key. In all cases, the activation secret <strong class="normative">SHALL</strong> remain within the authenticator and its associated user endpoint.</p>

<p>Authenticators that use activation secrets <strong class="normative">SHALL</strong> require the secrets to be at least four characters in length and <strong class="normative">SHOULD</strong> require the secrets to be at least six characters in length. Activation secrets <strong class="normative">MAY</strong> be entirely numeric (i.e., a PIN). Otherwise, all printing ASCII <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63b.html#ref-RFC20">[RFC20]</a> characters, the space character, and Unicode <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63b.html#ref-ISOIEC10646">[ISO/ISC 10646]</a> characters <strong class="normative">SHOULD</strong> be permitted in activation secrets. The authenticator or its management tools <strong class="normative">SHOULD</strong> implement a blocklist to discourage subscribers from selecting commonly used activation secrets (e.g., 123456).</p>

<p>The authenticator or verifier <strong class="normative">SHALL</strong> implement a retry-limiting mechanism that limits the number of consecutive failed activation attempts using the authenticator to no more than 10. If an incorrect activation secret entry causes the authenticator to provide an invalid output to the central verifier, the verifier <strong class="normative">MAY</strong> implement this retry-limiting mechanism. Otherwise, retry limiting <strong class="normative">SHALL</strong> be implemented in the authenticator. Once the limit of attempts is reached, the authenticator <strong class="normative">SHALL</strong> be disabled, and a different authenticator <strong class="normative">SHALL</strong> be required for authentication.</p>

<p>For authenticators that are usable at AAL3, verification of activation secrets <strong class="normative">SHALL</strong> be performed in a hardware-protected environment (e.g., a secure element, TPM, or TEE).

<p>Wireless authenticator connections are potentially vulnerable to threats, including eavesdropping, injection, and relay attacks. Wireless connections include technologies that function in the absence of a physical connection, such as radio frequency (e.g., Bluetooth and NFC), optical, and acoustic technologies.</p>

<p>The potential for such attacks on wireless connections depends on the technology’s effective range. To minimize the attack surface for threats to the authenticator-endpoint connection, the authentication process <strong class="normative">SHALL</strong> require physical proximity between the authenticator and endpoint by establishing a wireless connection with a range of no more than 240 meters.<sup id="fnref:range" role="doc-noteref"><a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63b.html#fn:range" class="footnote">3</a></sup></p>

<p>Wireless connections <strong class="normative">SHALL</strong> establish a key for encrypted communication between the authenticator and endpoint in one of the following ways:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Through a temporary wired connection between the devices.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Through an association process that is similar to a pairing process but does not require a persistent relationship between devices to establish a key for encrypted communication between the authenticator and endpoint. The association process <strong class="normative">SHALL</strong> employ a pairing code<sup id="fnref:pcode" role="doc-noteref"><a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63b.html#fn:pcode" class="footnote">4</a></sup> or other shared secret between the devices.

The pairing code <strong class="normative">SHALL</strong> be at least six decimal digits (or equivalent) in length. It <strong class="normative">SHALL</strong> be conveyed between the devices by manual entry or using a QR code or similar representation that is optically communicated.</p>

</ol>

<p>When using a wireless technology with an effective range of less than 1 meter (e.g., NFC), any activation secret transmitted from the endpoint to the authenticator <strong class="normative">SHALL</strong> be encrypted using a key that is established between the devices.

  <p>Encrypting only the activation secret and not the entire authentication transaction may expose sensitive information (e.g., the identity of the RP), although this would require the attacker to be very close to the subscriber. Special care should be taken with authenticators that contain personal information but do not require authenticated pairing. Encryption <strong class="normative">SHOULD</strong> be used to protect that information against eavesdropping attacks.</p>

<p>Network connections and wireless technologies with an effective range of 1 meter or more (e.g., Bluetooth Low Energy [BLE]) <strong class="normative">SHALL</strong> use an authenticated protected channel between the authenticator and endpoint. The entire authentication transaction <strong class="normative">SHALL</strong> be encrypted.</p>

<p>The key established by the association process may be either temporary (i.e., valid for a limited number of transactions or time-limited) or persistent. A mechanism for endpoints to remove persistent keys <strong class="normative">SHALL</strong> be provided.</p>

<p>An example of a wireless connection with an authenticator is the virtual contact interface specified in <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63b.html#ref-SP800-73pt2">[SP800-73pt2]</a>.</p>

<p>Hybrid connections use a combination of technologies to establish a secure connection between the authenticator and endpoint via a network tunnel service. A visual representation (e.g., QR code) is used to support key establishment between the authenticator and endpoint, which is supplemented by a wireless technology (e.g., Bluetooth LE) to require physical proximity between the parties when the association is made. The requirement for physical proximity of the authenticator reduces the potential for phishing attacks that might otherwise associate the authenticator with an attacker endpoint.</p>

<p>Hybrid connections (e.g., hybrid transports specified by the CTAP2.2 protocol <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63b.html#ref-FIDO2">[FIDO2]</a>) <strong class="normative">SHALL</strong> be established between authenticators and endpoints in one of the following ways:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>By communicating initial keying information and the identity of the tunnel service to be used via a displayed QR code or similar visual representation coupled with the receipt by the endpoint of wireless data containing the additional information required to establish the tunnel connection. The wireless data <strong class="normative">SHALL</strong> be conveyed over a technology with a maximum effective range of no more than 240 meters.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Through cached keying and tunnel information retained by the authenticator and endpoint from a previous authentication transaction.</p>

</h3>

<p>Exportability is the ability of an authenticator to replicate, share, or store its authentication keys outside of the protected boundary of the authenticator (e.g., copying it to another authenticator, backing up a key to a separate storage location).  Generally, authentication keys are considered exportable unless the authenticator generates, stores, and uses the keys in a protected hardware environment that prevents software from accessing the keys, such as in a security coprocessor (e.g., TPM) or a dedicated device (e.g., a security key). This is intended to prevent software on the endpoint from copying or leaking the authentication secret. Non-exportable authentication keys are considered more secure, and accordingly, non-exportable cryptographic keys are required at AAL3. The authentication keys on syncable authenticators are inherently exportable (see <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63b.html#appB">Appendix B</a>).</p>

<p>To be considered non-exportable, an authenticator <strong class="normative">SHALL</strong> either be a separate piece of hardware or an embedded processor or execution environment (e.g., secure element, TEE, TPM). These hardware authenticators and embedded processors are separate from a host processor, such as the CPU on a laptop or mobile device. A non-exportable authenticator <strong class="normative">SHALL</strong> be designed to prohibit the export of the authentication secret to the host processor and <strong class="normative">SHALL NOT</strong> be capable of being reprogrammed by the host processor to allow the secret to be extracted. The authenticator is subject to applicable <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63b.html#ref-FIPS140">[FIPS140]</a> requirements. Organizations <strong class="normative">SHOULD</strong> employ authenticators that have undergone independent security testing, such as authenticators validated to <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63b.html#ref-FIPS140">[FIPS140]</a> security level 2 overall with level 3 physical security<sup id="fnref:FIPS" role="doc-noteref"><a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63b.html#fn:FIPS" class="footnote">6</a></sup> or evaluated against relevant Common Criteria Protection Profiles.</p>

<p><em>This section is normative.</em></p>

<p>Events can occur over the lifetime of a subscriber’s authenticator and affect its use. These events include binding, maintenance, loss, theft, compromise, unauthorized duplication, expiration, and revocation. This section describes the actions to be taken in response to those events.</p>

</h2>

<p><em>Authenticator binding</em> refers to establishing an association between a specific authenticator and a subscriber account to enable the authenticator to authenticate for that subscriber account, possibly in conjunction with other authenticators.</p>

<p>Authenticators <strong class="normative">SHALL</strong> be bound to subscriber accounts by either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Being issued by the CSP as part of enrollment or</li>
  <li>Using a subscriber-provided authenticator that is acceptable to the CSP.</li>
</ul>

<p>The SP 800-63 suite of guidelines refers to the <em>binding</em> rather than the issuance of authenticators to accommodate both options.</p>

<p>Throughout the lifetime of a digital identity, CSPs <strong class="normative">SHALL</strong> maintain a record of all authenticators that are bound to each subscriber account. The CSP <strong class="normative">SHALL</strong> determine the characteristics of the authenticator being bound (e.g., single-factor versus multi-factor, phishing-resistant or not) so that verifiers can assess compliance with the requirements at each AAL. This determination <strong class="normative">MAY</strong> be based on strong evidence (e.g., authenticator attestation), direct information from having issued the authenticator, or typical characteristics of authenticator implementations (e.g., whether a user verification bit is set by <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63b.html#ref-WebAuthn">[WebAuthn]</a>).</p>

<p>The CSP <strong class="normative">SHALL</strong> also maintain other state information that is required to meet the authenticator verification requirements. For example, the throttling of authentication attempts described in <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63b.html#throttle">Sec. 3.2.2</a> requires the CSP or verifier to maintain state information on recent failed authentication attempts, except for activation factors verified at the authenticator.</p>

<p>The record created by the CSP <strong class="normative">SHALL</strong> contain the date and time of significant authenticator life cycle events (e.g., binding to the subscriber account, renewal, update, expiration). The record <strong class="normative">SHOULD</strong> include information about the source of the binding (e.g., IP address, device identifier) of any device associated with the event.</p>

<p>As part of the binding process, the CSP <strong class="normative">MAY</strong> require additional information about the new authenticator or its associated endpoint to determine whether it is suitable for the requested AAL.</p>

<p>Binding at the time of enrollment is considered to be part of the enrollment process and is discussed in <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63a.html#introduction" latex-href="#ref-SP800-63A">[SP800-63A]</a>.</p>

</h4>

<p>To minimize the need for account recovery, CSPs and verifiers <strong class="normative">SHOULD</strong> encourage subscribers to maintain at least two separate means of authentication. For example, a subscriber who usually uses an OTP authenticator as a physical authenticator <strong class="normative">MAY</strong> also be issued look-up secret authenticators or register a device for out-of-band authentication to be used if the physical authenticator is lost, stolen, or damaged. See <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63b.html#recovery">Sec. 4.2</a> for more information on replacing passwords.</p>

<p>Accordingly, CSPs <strong class="normative">SHALL</strong> permit the binding of multiple authenticators to a subscriber account. When any new authenticator is bound to a subscriber account, the CSP <strong class="normative">SHALL</strong> ensure that the process requires authentication at either the maximum AAL currently available in the subscriber account or the maximum AAL at which the new authenticator will be used, whichever is lower. For example, binding an authenticator that is suitable for use at AAL2 requires authentication at AAL2 unless the subscriber account currently has only AAL1 authentication capabilities. When an authenticator is added, the CSP <strong class="normative">SHALL</strong> notify the subscriber via a mechanism independent of the transaction binding the new authenticator, as described in <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63b.html#notification">Sec. 4.6</a>.</p>

</h4>

<p>It may be necessary for a subscriber to bind an authenticator to a subscriber account using a device that is different from the authenticated endpoint (i.e., the endpoint for the session being authenticated). This process is typically used when adding authenticators that are embedded in a new endpoint or when connectivity limitations prevent the newly bound authenticator from being connected to an authenticated endpoint.</p>

<p>The binding process <strong class="normative">SHALL</strong> proceed in one of the following ways:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>An endpoint that has authenticated to the CSP requests a binding code from the CSP. The binding code is input into the endpoint associated with the new authenticator and sent to the CSP.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The endpoint associated with the new authenticator obtains a binding code from the CSP. The binding code is input to an authenticated endpoint and sent to the CSP.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<div latex-literal="true" class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>\clearpage

<p>In addition to the requirements in <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63b.html#bindexisting">Sec. 4.1.2.1</a> and <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63b.html#recovery">Sec. 4.2</a>, the following requirements <strong class="normative">SHALL</strong> apply when binding an external authenticator:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>An authenticated protected channel <strong class="normative">SHALL</strong> be established by the endpoint associated with the new authenticator and the CSP.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The subscriber <strong class="normative">MAY</strong> be prompted to enter an identifier by which the CSP knows them on the endpoint associated with the new authenticator.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The CSP <strong class="normative">SHALL</strong> generate a <em>binding code</em> using an approved random bit generator, as described in <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63b.html#randomness">Sec. 3.2.12</a> and send it to either the new authenticator endpoint or the authenticated endpoint approving the binding. The binding code <strong class="normative">SHALL</strong> be at least 40 bits in length if it is used with an identifier that was entered in the previous step. Otherwise, a binding code of at least 112 bits in length <strong class="normative">SHALL</strong> be required.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The subscriber <strong class="normative">SHALL</strong> transfer the binding code to the other endpoint. This transfer <strong class="normative">SHALL</strong> either be manual or via a local out-of-band method (e.g., QR code). The binding code <strong class="normative">SHALL NOT</strong> be communicated over any insecure channel (e.g., email).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The binding code <strong class="normative">SHALL</strong> be usable only once and <strong class="normative">SHALL</strong> be valid for a maximum of 10 minutes.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Following the binding of the new authenticator (or issuance of a certificate, in the case of PKI-based authenticators), the CSP <strong class="normative">SHOULD</strong> encourage the subscriber to authenticate with the new authenticator to confirm that the process has been completed successfully.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The CSP <strong class="normative">SHALL</strong> provide clear instructions on what the subscriber should do in the event of an authenticator binding mishap (e.g., making a button available to be pressed or a contact address to be used to allow a misbound authenticator to be quickly invalidated), as appropriate. This <strong class="normative">MAY</strong> be provided in the authenticated session in addition to the binding notification described in <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63b.html#notification">Sec. 4.6</a>.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The binding of an external authenticator may introduce risks due to the potential for the subscriber to be tricked into using a binding code by an attacker or supplying a binding code to an attacker. In some cases, representations (e.g., QR codes) obtained from a trusted source (e.g., an authenticated session, especially when that authentication is phishing-resistant) are considered to be more robust against such attacks because they typically contain the URL of the CSP in addition to the binding code. As a result, there is less potential for the subscriber to be fooled into entering a binding code at a phishing site.</p>

    Binding to a Subscriber-Provided Authenticator <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63b.html#bind-subscriber-authenticator" class="header-link"><i class="fa fa-link"></i></a>
  
  
</h3>

<p>A subscriber may already possess authenticators that are suitable for authentication at a particular AAL. For example, the subscriber may have their own multi-factor authenticator and would like to use that authenticator at a verifier that requires AAL2.</p>

<p>CSPs <strong class="normative">SHOULD</strong>, where practical, accommodate subscriber-provided authenticators to relieve the burden on the subscriber of managing many authenticators. The binding of these authenticators <strong class="normative">SHALL</strong> be done as described in <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63b.html#post-enroll-bind">Sec. 4.1.2</a>.</p>

<p>As part of this process, CSPs will need to establish the capabilities and characteristics of the subscriber-provided authenticator that they wish to accept to determine its suitability for the use case and the intended AAL. The level of assurance that the CSP requires in the fidelity of these authenticator attributes <strong class="normative">MAY</strong> vary depending on the use case and threat environment. Some authenticators, such as those based on the WebAuthn standard <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63b.html#ref-WebAuthn">[WebAuthn]</a>, provide metadata about the authenticator during the binding or authentication process that can be used by the CSP to inform its decisions. This metadata, for example, could indicate whether an authenticator uses an activation factor to function as a multi-factor authenticator. Similarly, some subscriber-controlled wallets will also offer metadata about its functions, including information about the mechanisms used to unlock the wallet. CSPs <strong class="normative">SHOULD</strong> consider this metadata when choosing how to support a subscriber-provided authenticator. In many cases, such information will not be available, and CSPs <strong class="normative">SHOULD</strong> evaluate the characteristics of commercially available authenticators that are likely to be used by their subscribers and make determinations about what authenticators they will accept. The types of authenticators accepted by the CSP <strong class="normative">SHALL</strong> be documented in the CSP practice statement.</p>

<p>In some high assurance use cases, CSPs may desire additional confidence in the attributes of the authenticators registered by their subscribers. Some authenticators support attestation features that can be used to determine the capabilities and manufacturers of specific authenticators. However, such attestation features are not widely available in authenticators that are likely to be used by public users. The lack of support for attestations <strong class="normative">SHOULD NOT</strong> block the use of authenticators for broad public-facing applications.</p>

</h3>

<p>The subscriber <strong class="normative">SHOULD</strong> bind a new or updated authenticator before an existing authenticator’s expiration. The process for this <strong class="normative">SHOULD</strong> conform closely to the binding process for an additional authenticator, as described in <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63b.html#post-enroll-bind">Sec. 4.1.2</a>. The CSP <strong class="normative">MAY</strong> periodically take other actions (e.g., confirming contact addresses) as a part of the renewal process or separately. Following the successful use of the replacement authenticator, the CSP <strong class="normative">SHOULD</strong> invalidate the expiring authenticator.</p>

</h2>

<p><em>Account recovery</em> is when a subscriber recovers from losing control of the authenticators that are needed to authenticate at a desired AAL. This may be accomplished by repeating portions of the identity proofing process, using a prearranged recovery contact, or presenting one or more recovery codes, perhaps in conjunction with using an authenticator that is still available to the subscriber bound to their subscriber account. Once this is completed, the subscriber can bind one or more new authenticators to their subscriber account. An account recovery event always causes one or more notifications to be sent to the subscriber to help detect the fraudulent use of account recovery.</p>

<p>Account recovery differs from authentication in several ways. Since account recovery is expected to be invoked infrequently, it is generally less convenient than authentication and — depending on the situation and recovery methods offered by the CSP — may involve extended waiting times.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Replacement of a forgotten password where the subscriber can authenticate with one or more other authenticators is considered to be the binding of a new authenticator (see Sec. <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63b.html#bindexisting">4.1.2.1</a>) rather than account recovery.</p>

<p>Four general classes of account recovery methods are recognized:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Saved recovery codes</li>
  <li>Issued recovery codes</li>
  <li>Use of recovery contacts</li>
  <li>Repeated identity proofing</li>
</ul>

<p>CSPs <strong class="normative">SHALL</strong> support one or more of these and <strong class="normative">MAY</strong> support an application-specific method (e.g., interaction with a CSP agent) to recover a subscriber account.

</h4>

<p>At enrollment, a CSP that supports this recovery option <strong class="normative">SHOULD</strong> issue a recovery code to the subscriber. The recovery code <strong class="normative">SHALL</strong> include at least 64 bits from an approved random bit generator. The saved recovery code may be presented as numeric or a printable ASCII representation (e.g., Base64) for manual entry or as a machine-readable optical label (e.g., QR code) that contains the recovery code. At any point following enrollment, the subscriber <strong class="normative">MAY</strong> request a replacement recovery code. The issuance of a replacement recovery code <strong class="normative">SHALL</strong> result in an account recovery notification, as described in <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63b.html#notification">Sec. 4.6</a>.</p>

<p>Saved recovery codes are intended to be maintained offline (e.g., printed or written down) and stored securely by the subscriber for future use.

<p>CSPs that support this option allow the subscriber to maintain one or more recovery addresses (e.g., postal, email, text message, voice). When recovery is required, a recovery code will be sent to a claimant-chosen address. The issued recovery code <strong class="normative">SHALL</strong> include at least six decimal digits (or equivalent) from an approved random bit generator, as described in <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63b.html#randomness">Sec. 3.2.12</a>. The issued recovery code may be presented as a numeric or a printable ASCII representation (e.g., Base64) for manual entry, a secure (e.g., https) link with a representation of the recovery code, or a machine-readable optical label (e.g., QR code) that contains the recovery code.</p>

<p>Compromised authenticators include those that have been lost, stolen, or subject to unauthorized duplication or that have activation factors that are no longer in the subscriber’s control. Generally, one must assume that a lost authenticator has been stolen or compromised by someone other than the legitimate holder of the authenticator.

<p>The CSP <strong class="normative">SHALL</strong> suspend, invalidate, or destroy compromised authenticators from the subscriber’s account promptly following compromise detection. Organizations <strong class="normative">SHOULD</strong> establish time limits for this process.</p>

<p>To facilitate the secure reporting of an authenticator’s loss, theft, damage, or compromise, the CSP <strong class="normative">SHOULD</strong> provide the subscriber with a method of authenticating using a backup or alternate authenticator. This backup authenticator <strong class="normative">SHALL</strong> be a password or a physical authenticator. Either could be used, but only one authentication factor is required to make this report. Alternatively, the subscriber <strong class="normative">MAY</strong> establish an authenticated protected channel for the CSP to verify the information collected during identity proofing.

<p>The invalidation of an authenticator (sometimes referred to as revocation or termination) is the removal of the binding between the authenticator and a subscriber account.</p>

<p>CSPs <strong class="normative">SHALL</strong> promptly invalidate authenticators when a subscriber account ceases to exist (e.g., subscriber’s death, the discovery of a fraudulent subscriber), when requested by the subscriber, when the authenticator is compromised, or when the CSP determines that the subscriber no longer meets its eligibility requirements. The CSP <strong class="normative">SHALL</strong> make a risk-based determination of the authenticity of invalidation requests from the subscriber. The consequences of not invalidating a compromised authenticator are usually more significant than the denial-of-service potential of invalidating one in error.</p>

<p>Certain subscriber account events (e.g., the binding of an authenticator, account recovery) require the subscriber or someone designated by them to be independently notified. These notifications help the subscriber detect possible fraud associated with their subscriber account.</p>

<p>Events that require notification <strong class="normative">SHALL</strong> cause a notification to be sent to the notification addresses stored in the subscriber account. Notification addresses may be any means by which the subscriber can be reliably contacted, such as:</p>

<ul>

  <li>Email address</li>
  <li>Address (e.g., telephone number) to which a text message or voice message may be sent</li>
  <li>Reference to the subscriber in a push notification service</li>

<p>CSPs <strong class="normative">SHALL</strong> support at least two notification addresses per subscriber account.

</h1>

<p><em>This section is normative.</em></p>

<p>Once an authentication event has occurred, it is often desirable to allow the subscriber to continue using the application across multiple subsequent interactions without requiring them to repeat the authentication event. This is particularly the case with federation scenarios (see <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63c.html#introduction" latex-href="#ref-SP800-63C">[SP800-63C]</a>) in which the authentication event necessarily involves the coordination of several components and parties across a network.</p>

<p>To facilitate this behavior, a <em>session</em> <strong class="normative">MAY</strong> be started in response to an authentication event and continue until it is terminated. The session <strong class="normative">MAY</strong> be terminated for any number of reasons, including an inactivity timeout or an explicit logout event. The session <strong class="normative">MAY</strong> be extended through a reauthentication event (see <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63b.html#sessionreauthn">Sec. 5.2</a>) in which the subscriber repeats some of the initial authentication process or performs a full authentication, thereby reestablishing the authenticated session.</p>

<p>Session management is preferable to the continual presentation of credentials, as the poor usability of continual presentation often creates incentives for workarounds (e.g., caching activation factors), thereby negating authentication intent and obscuring the freshness of the authentication event.</p>

</h2>

<p>A session occurs between the software (i.e., the session subject) that a subscriber is running (e.g., browser, application, operating system) and the RP or CSP that the subscriber is accessing (i.e., the session host). A session secret <strong class="normative">SHALL</strong> be shared between the subscriber’s software and the accessed service. This secret binds the two ends of the session and allows the subscriber to continue using the service over time. The secret <strong class="normative">SHALL</strong> be directly presented by the subscriber’s software, or possession of the secret <strong class="normative">SHALL</strong> be proven using a cryptographic mechanism.</p>

<p>The continuity of authenticated sessions <strong class="normative">SHALL</strong> be based on the possession of a session secret that is issued by the session host at the time of authentication and optionally refreshed during the session. The nature of a session depends on the application, such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A web browser session with a “session” cookie</li>
  <li>An instance of a mobile application that retains a session secret</li>
</ul>

<p>Session secrets that are used as bearer tokens for session management <strong class="normative">SHOULD NOT</strong> be persistent (i.e., retained across a restart of the associated application or a reboot of the host device) because they are tied to specific sessions that a restart or reboot would end. Cookies and similar “remember my browser” features <strong class="normative">SHALL NOT</strong> be used instead of authentication except as provided for reauthentication at AAL2 in <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63b.html#aal2reauth">Sec. 2.2.3</a> when the inactivity limit has been exceeded but the time limit has not.</p>

<p>Some technologies (e.g., the emerging device bound session credentials specification <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63b.html#ref-dbsc">[DBSC]</a>) mitigate the risk of theft of session secrets by using cryptographic protocols that prove the possession of a session secret rather than using them as bearer tokens. These technologies might additionally store and use these session secrets in protected keystores to reduce the risk of exfiltration by malware. Session secrets used with such proof of possession techniques <strong class="normative">MAY</strong> persist. However, RPs and CSPs <strong class="normative">SHALL</strong> ensure that the session lifetime limits described in <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63b.html#aal2reauth">Sec. 2.2.3</a> are enforced even when a knowledge of the session secret is demonstrated.</p>

<p>The secret used for session binding <strong class="normative">SHALL</strong> be generated by the session host in direct response to an authentication event. A session <strong class="normative">SHOULD</strong> inherit the AAL properties of the authentication event that triggered its creation. A session <strong class="normative">MAY</strong> be considered at a lower AAL than the authentication event but <strong class="normative">SHALL NOT</strong> be considered at a higher AAL than the authentication event.</p>

<p>The secrets used for session binding <strong class="normative">SHALL</strong> meet all of the following requirements:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Secrets are established during or immediately following authentication.</li>
  <li>Secrets are established using input from an approved random bit generator, as described in <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63b.html#randomness">Sec. 3.2.12</a>, and are at least 64 bits in length.</li>
  <li>Secrets are erased or invalidated by the session subject when the subscriber logs out.</li>
  <li>Secrets are either transferred from the session host to the RP or CSP via an authenticated protected channel or derived from keys that are established as part of establishing a valid, mutually authenticated protected channel.</li>
  <li>Secrets will time out and are not accepted after the times specified in <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63b.html#aal1reauth">Sec. 2.1.3</a>, <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63b.html#aal2reauth">Sec. 2.2.3</a>, and <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63b.html#aal3reauth">Sec. 2.3.3</a>, as appropriate for the AAL.</li>
  <li>Secrets are unavailable to intermediaries between the host and the subscriber’s endpoint.</li>
</ol>

<p>In addition, the secrets used for session binding <strong class="normative">SHOULD</strong> be erased on the subscriber endpoint when they log out or when the secret is deemed to have expired. They <strong class="normative">SHOULD NOT</strong> be placed in insecure locations (e.g., HTML5 Local Storage) due to the potential exposure of local storage to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.</p>

<p>Following authentication, authenticated sessions <strong class="normative">SHALL NOT</strong> fall back to an insecure transport (e.g., from https to http).</p>

<p>POST/PUT content <strong class="normative">SHALL</strong> contain a session identifier that the RP <strong class="normative">SHALL</strong> verify to protect against cross-site request forgery (CSRF).</p>

<p>Several mechanisms exist for managing a session over time. The following sections give different examples, additional requirements, and considerations for each example technology. Additional informative guidance is available in the Open Worldwide Application Security Project (OWASP) <em>Session Management Cheat Sheet</em> <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63b.html#ref-OWASP-session">[OWASP-session]</a>.</p>

<p>Sessions <strong class="normative">SHOULD</strong> provide a readily accessible mechanism for subscribers to terminate (i.e., log off) their session when their interaction is complete. Session logoff gives the subscriber additional confidence and control over the security of their session, particularly if the endpoint might be accessible to others.</p>

</h3>

<p>Browser cookies are the predominant mechanism by which a session is created and tracked when a subscriber accesses a service. Cookies are not authenticators but are suitable as short-term secrets for the duration of a session.</p>

<p>Cookies used for session maintenance:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong class="normative">SHALL</strong> be tagged to be accessible only on secure (i.e., HTTPS) sessions.</li>
  <li><strong class="normative">SHALL</strong> be accessible to the minimum practical hostnames and paths.</li>
  <li><strong class="normative">SHOULD</strong> be tagged as inaccessible via JavaScript (i.e., HttpOnly).</li>
  <li><strong class="normative">SHOULD</strong> be tagged to expire at or soon after the session’s validity period. This requirement is intended to limit the accumulation of cookies but <strong class="normative">SHALL NOT</strong> be relied upon to enforce session timeouts.</li>
  <li><strong class="normative">SHOULD</strong> have the “__Host-“ prefix and set “Path=/”.</li>
  <li><strong class="normative">SHOULD</strong> set “SameSite=Lax” or “SameSite=Strict”.</li>

</h3>

<p>An access token (e.g., OAuth <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63b.html#ref-RFC6749">[RFC6749]</a>) is used to allow an application to access a set of services on a subscriber’s behalf following an authentication event. The RP <strong class="normative">SHALL NOT</strong> interpret the presence of an access token as an indicator of the subscriber’s presence in the absence of other signals. The access token and any associated refresh tokens could be valid long after the authentication session has ended and the subscriber has left the application.</p>

</h2>

<p>The periodic reauthentication of sessions <strong class="normative">SHALL</strong> be performed to confirm the subscriber’s continued presence at an authenticated session (e.g., that the subscriber has not walked away without logging out).</p>

<p>Session management uses two types of timeouts. An <em>overall timeout</em> limits the duration of an authenticated session to a specific period following authentication or a previous reauthentication. An <em>inactivity timeout</em> terminates a session without activity from the subscriber for a specific period. For both types of timeouts, the RP <strong class="normative">MAY</strong> alert the subscriber that the session is about to be terminated and allow the subscriber to make the session active or reauthenticate as appropriate before the session expires. When either timeout expires, the session <strong class="normative">SHALL</strong> be terminated. Session activity <strong class="normative">SHALL</strong> reset the inactivity timeout, and successful reauthentication during a session <strong class="normative">SHALL</strong> reset both timeouts.</p>

<p>The overall and inactivity timeout expiration limits depend on several factors, including the AAL of the session, the environment in which the session is conducted (e.g., whether the subscriber is in a restricted area), the type of endpoint being used (e.g., mobile application, web-based), whether the endpoint is a managed device,<sup id="fnref:managed" role="doc-noteref"><a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63b.html#fn:managed" class="footnote">1</a></sup> and the nature of the application itself. The limits <strong class="normative">MAY</strong> also be extended when higher security session maintenance technologies (e.g., device-bound mechanisms) are used. Agencies <strong class="normative">SHALL</strong> establish and document the inactivity and overall time limits being enforced in a system security plan, such as that described in <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63b.html#ref-SP800-39">[SP800-39]</a>. Detailed requirements for each AAL are given in <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63b.html#aal1reauth">Sec. 2.1.3</a>, <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63b.html#aal2reauth">Sec. 2.2.3</a>, and <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63b.html#aal3reauth">Sec. 2.3.3</a>.</p>

<p>Special considerations apply to session management and reauthentication when using a federation protocol and IdP to authenticate at the RP, as described in <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63c.html#introduction" latex-href="#ref-SP800-63C">[SP800-63C]</a>. The federation protocol communicates an authentication event at the IdP to the RP using an assertion, and the RP then begins an authenticated session based on the successful validation of this assertion. Since the IdP and RP manage sessions separately from each other and the federation protocol does not connect the session management between the IdP and RP, the termination of the subscriber’s sessions at an IdP and RP are independent of each other. Likewise, the subscriber’s sessions at multiple different RPs are established and terminated independently of each other.</p>

<p>Consequently, when an RP session expires and the RP requires reauthentication, it is possible that the session at the IdP has not expired and that a new assertion could be generated from this session at the IdP without explicitly reauthenticating the subscriber. The IdP can communicate the time and details of the authentication event to the RP, but the RP <strong class="normative">SHALL</strong> be authoritative as to whether the reauthentication requirements have been met. <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63c.html#federation-session" latex-href="#ref-SP800-63C">Section 4.7 of [SP800-63C]</a> provides additional details and requirements for session management within a federation context.</p>

<p>Session monitoring (sometimes called <em>continuous authentication</em>) is the ongoing evaluation of session characteristics to detect possible fraud during a session. Session monitoring <strong class="normative">MAY</strong> be performed by the RP in coordination with the CSP or IdP and associated verifier as a risk reduction measure.

</h2>

<p>An attacker who can gain control of an authenticator will often be able to masquerade as the authenticator’s owner. Threats to authenticators can be categorized based on attacks on the types of authentication factors that comprise the authenticator:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>“Something you know” may be disclosed to an attacker. For example, the attacker may guess a password. If the authenticator is a shared secret, the attacker could access the CSP or verifier and obtain the secret value or perform a dictionary attack on a hash of that value. An attacker may observe the entry of a PIN or passcode, find a written record or journal entry of a PIN or passcode, or install malicious software (e.g., a keyboard logger) to capture the secret. Additionally, an attacker may determine the secret through offline attacks on a password database maintained by the verifier.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>“Something you have” may be lost, damaged, stolen from the owner, or cloned by an attacker. For example, an attacker who gains access to the owner’s computer may copy a software authenticator. A hardware authenticator may be stolen, tampered with, or duplicated. Out-of-band secrets may be intercepted by an attacker and used to authenticate their own session. A subscriber may be <em>socially engineered</em> to provide access to secrets without intentional collusion.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>“Something you are” may be replicated, or a false match may occur. For example, an attacker may obtain a copy of the subscriber’s fingerprint and construct a replica.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Subscribers sometimes intentionally collude with attackers, and virtually nothing can be done from an authentication perspective to prevent these attacks. With this caveat in mind, threats to the authenticators used for digital authentication are listed in <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63b.html#table-3">Table 3</a> along with some examples.</p>

<p>Several other strategies may be applied to mitigate the threats described in <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63b.html#table-4">Table 4</a>:</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>Multiple factors</em> make successful attacks more difficult to accomplish. If an attacker must steal a cryptographic authenticator and guess a password, then the work to discover both factors may be too high.</li>
  <li><em>Physical security mechanisms</em> may be employed to protect a stolen authenticator from duplication. Physical security mechanisms can provide tamper evidence, detection, and response.</li>
  <li><em>Requiring long passwords</em> that do not appear in common dictionaries may force attackers to try every possible value.</li>
  <li><em>System and network security controls</em> may be employed to prevent an attacker from gaining access to a system or installing malicious software.</li>
  <li><em>Periodic training</em> may be performed to ensure that subscribers understand when and how to report a compromise or a suspicion of compromise and to recognize patterns of behavior that may signify that an attacker is attempting to compromise the authentication process.</li>

<p>The weak point in many authentication mechanisms is the process followed when a subscriber loses control of one or more authenticators and needs to replace them. In many cases, the options for authenticating the subscriber are limited, and economic concerns (e.g., the cost of maintaining call centers) motivate the use of inexpensive and often less secure backup authentication methods. To the extent that authenticator recovery is human-assisted, social engineering attacks also pose risks.</p>

<p>To maintain the integrity of the authentication factors, it is essential that one authentication factor cannot be leveraged to obtain an authenticator of a different factor. For example, a password must not be usable to obtain a new list of look-up secrets.</p>

</h2>

<p>Hijacking attacks on the session following an authentication event can have similar security impacts. The session management guidelines in <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63b.html#sessmgmt">Sec. 5</a> are essential to maintaining session integrity against attacks (e.g., XSS). It is also important to sanitize all information to be displayed <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63b.html#ref-OWASP-XSS-prevention">[OWASP-XSS-prevention]</a> to ensure that it does not contain executable content. These guidelines recommend that session secrets be made inaccessible to mobile code to provide extra protection against the exfiltration of session secrets.</p>

<p>Another post-authentication threat is CSRF, which takes advantage of users’ tendency to have multiple sessions active simultaneously. It is essential to embed and verify a session identifier for web requests to prevent a valid URL or request from being unintentionally or maliciously activated.</p>

<p>The authentication requirements in <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63b.html#AAL_SEC4">Sec. 2</a> and the optional session monitoring guidelines in <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63b.html#monitoring">Sec. 5.3</a> require the CSP to conduct a privacy risk assessment for records retention. Such a privacy risk assessment would include evaluating:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The likelihood that the records retention could create a privacy problem for the subscriber, such as loss of trust</li>
  <li>The impact if such a problem did occur</li>
</ul>

<p>CSPs should be able to reasonably justify any response to identified privacy risks, including accepting, mitigating, and sharing the risk.

</h2>

<p><a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63b.html#aal_privacy">Section 2.4.3</a> requires CSPs to maintain the objectives of predictability (i.e., enabling reliable assumptions by individuals, owners, and operators about personal information and its processing by an information system) and manageability (providing the capability for the granular administration of personal information, including alteration, deletion, and selective disclosure) commensurate with privacy risks that can arise from processing attributes for purposes other than identity proofing, authentication, authorization, attribute assertion, or related fraud mitigation or compliance with laws or legal processes <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63b.html#ref-NISTIR8062">[NISTIR8062]</a>.</p>

<p>CSPs may have various business purposes for processing attributes, including providing non-identity services to subscribers. However, processing attributes for purposes other than those specified at collection can create privacy risks. CSPs can identify appropriate measures that are commensurate with the privacy risks that arise from additional processing. For example, absent applicable laws, regulations, or policies, obtaining consent may not be necessary when processing attributes to provide non-identity services requested by subscribers. However, notices may help subscribers maintain reliable assumptions about the processing (i.e., predictability). Other processing of attributes may carry different privacy risks that call for obtaining consent or allowing subscribers more control over the use or disclosure of specific attributes (i.e., manageability). Subscriber consent must be meaningful. Therefore, as stated in <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63b.html#aal_privacy">Sec. 2.4.3</a>, when CSPs use consent measures, the subscriber’s acceptance of additional uses shall not be a condition of providing authentication services.</p>

<p>Consult the SAOP if there are questions about whether the proposed processing falls outside of the scope of the permitted processing or appropriate privacy risk mitigation measures.</p>

</h2>

<p><a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63b.html#aal_privacy">Section 2.4.3</a> describes specific compliance obligations for federal CSPs. It is critical to involve the SAOP in the earliest stages of digital authentication system development to assess and mitigate privacy risks and advise the agency on compliance requirements, such as whether or not the collection of personal information to issue or maintain authenticators triggers the <em>Privacy Act of 1974</em> <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63b.html#ref-PrivacyAct">[PrivacyAct]</a> or the <em>E-Government Act of 2002</em> <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63b.html#ref-E-Gov">[E-Gov]</a> requirement to conduct a PIA. For example, concerning the centralized maintenance of biometrics, Privacy Act requirements will likely be triggered and require coverage by a new or existing Privacy Act SORN due to the collection and maintenance of personal information and any other attributes that are necessary for authentication. The SAOP can similarly assist the agency in determining whether a PIA is required. These considerations should not be read as a requirement to develop a Privacy Act SORN or PIA for authentication alone. In many instances, a PIA and SORN can encompass the entire digital identity process or include the digital authentication process as part of a larger programmatic PIA that discusses the online services or benefits that the agency is establishing.</p>

<p>Due to the many components of digital authentication, the SAOP needs to be aware of and understand each component. For example, other privacy artifacts may apply to an agency that offers or uses federated CSP or RP services (e.g., Data Use Agreements, Computer Matching Agreements). The SAOP can assist the agency in determining what additional requirements apply. Moreover, a thorough understanding of the individual components of digital authentication will enable the SAOP to assess and mitigate privacy risks through compliance processes or other means.</p>

<p><em>This section is informative.</em></p>

<p>To align with the standard terminology of user-centered design, customer experience, and usability, the term “user” is used throughout this section to refer to the human party. In most cases, the user in question will be the subject in the role of applicant, claimant, or subscriber. Customer experience sits at the nexus of usability, accessibility, and optionality. Considering user needs allows organizations to provide responsive and secure identity solutions while minimizing unnecessary friction and frustration.</p>

</h2>

<p><a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63b.html#ref-ISOIEC9241">[ISO/IEC9241-11]</a> defines usability as the “extent to which a system, product, or service can be used by specified users to achieve specified goals with effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction in a specified context of use.” This definition focuses on users, their goals, and the contexts of use as the key elements necessary for achieving effectiveness, efficiency, satisfaction, and usability.</p>

<p>A user’s goal when accessing an information system is to perform an intended task. Authentication is the function that enables this goal. However, from the user’s perspective, authentication stands between them and their intended task. Effective design and implementation of the authentication process makes it easy to do the right thing, hard to do the wrong thing, and easy to recover if the wrong thing happens.</p>

<p>Organizations need to be cognizant of the overall implications of their stakeholders’ entire digital authentication ecosystem. Users often employ multiple authenticators, each for a different RP. They then struggle to remember passwords, recall which authenticator goes with which RP, and carry multiple physical authentication devices. Evaluating the usability of authentication is critical, as poor usability often results in coping mechanisms and unintended workarounds that can ultimately degrade the effectiveness of security controls.</p>

<p>Integrating usability into the development process can lead to authentication solutions that are secure and usable while still addressing users’ authentication needs and organizations’ business goals. The impacts of usability across digital systems needs to be considered as part of the risk assessment when deciding on the appropriate AAL. Authenticators with a higher AAL sometimes offer better usability and should be allowed for use with lower AAL applications.</p>

<p>Leveraging federation for authentication can alleviate many usability issues, though such an approach has its trade-offs, as discussed in <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63c.html#introduction" latex-href="#ref-SP800-63C">[SP800-63C]</a>.</p>

<p>This section provides general usability considerations and possible implementations but does not recommend specific solutions. The implementations mentioned are examples that encourage innovative technological approaches to address specific usability needs. Furthermore, usability considerations and their implementations are sensitive to many factors that prevent a one-size-fits-all solution. For example, a font size that works in a desktop computing environment may force text to scroll off of a small OTP authenticator screen. Performing a usability evaluation on the selected authenticator is a critical component of implementation. It is important to conduct evaluations with representative users, set realistic goals and tasks, and identify appropriate contexts of use.</p>

<p>Guidelines and considerations are described from the users’ perspective.</p>

<p>Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63b.html#ref-Section508">[Section508]</a> was enacted to eliminate barriers in information technology and require federal agencies to make electronic and information technology accessible to people with disabilities. While these guidelines do not directly assert requirements from Section 508, identity service providers are expected to comply with Section 508 provisions. Beyond compliance with Section 508, federal agencies and their service providers are generally expected to design services and systems with the experiences of people with disabilities in mind to ensure that accessibility is prioritized throughout identity system life cycles.</p>

    Common Usability Considerations for Authenticators <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63b.html#usabilitycommon" class="header-link"><i class="fa fa-link"></i></a>
  
  
</h3>

<p>When selecting and implementing an authentication system, consider usability across the entire lifetime of the selected authenticators (e.g., their typical use and intermittent events) while being mindful of users, their goals, and their contexts of use.</p>

<p>A single authenticator type does not usually suffice for the entire user population. Therefore, whenever possible and based on AAL requirements, CSPs should support alternative authenticator types and allow users to choose the type that best meets their needs. Task immediacy, perceived cost-benefit trade-offs, and unfamiliarity with certain authenticators often impact choices. Users tend to choose options that incur the least burden or cost at that moment. For example, if a task requires immediate access to an information system, a user may prefer to create a new subscriber account and password rather than select an authenticator that requires more steps. Alternatively, users may choose a federated identity option that is approved at the appropriate IAL, AAL, and <em>federation assurance level</em> (FAL) if they already have a subscriber account with an identity provider. Users may understand some authenticators better than others and have different levels of trust based on their understanding and experience.</p>

<p>Positive user authentication experiences are integral to achieving desired business outcomes. Therefore, organizations should strive to consider authenticators from the users’ perspective. The overarching authentication usability goal is to minimize user burden and authentication friction (e.g., the number of times a user has to authenticate, the steps involved, the amount of information they have to track). <em>Single sign-on</em> (SSO) exemplifies one such minimization strategy.</p>

<p>Usability considerations that are applicable to most authenticators include the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Provide information on the use and maintenance of the authenticator (e.g., what to do if the authenticator is lost or stolen) and instructions for use, especially if there are different requirements for first-time use or initialization.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Users will need to remember to have their authenticator readily available. Consider the need for alternative authentication options to protect against loss, damage, or other negative impacts on the original authenticator and the potential loss of battery power, if applicable.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Alternative authentication options based on AAL requirements allow users to choose an authenticator based on their context, goals, and tasks (e.g., the frequency and immediacy of the task). Alternative authentication options also help address availability issues that may occur with a particular authenticator.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Consider the characteristics of user-facing text:
    <ul>
      <li>Write user-facing text (e.g., instructions, prompts, notifications, error messages) in plain language for the intended audience. Avoid technical jargon, and write for the audience’s expected literacy level.</li>
      <li>Consider the legibility of user-facing and user-entered text, including font style, size, color, and contrast with the surrounding background. Illegible text contributes to user entry errors. To enhance legibility, consider the use of:
        <ul>
          <li>High contrast (i.e., black on white)</li>
          <li>Sans serif fonts for electronic displays and serif fonts for printed materials</li>
          <li>Fonts that clearly distinguish between characters that are easily confused (e.g., the capital letter “O” and the number zero “0”)</li>
          <li>A minimum font size of 12 points as long as the text fits for display on the device</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Avoid using icons (e.g., padlocks or shields) that might be confused with security indicators in browsers.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Consider user experience during authenticator entry:
    <ul>
      <li>Offer the option to display text during entry, as masked text entry is error-prone. Once a given character is displayed long enough for the user to see, it can be hidden. Consider the device when determining masking delay time, as it takes longer to enter passwords on mobile devices (e.g., tablets and smartphones) than on traditional desktop computers. Ensure that masking delay durations are consistent with user needs.</li>
      <li>Ensure that the time allowed for text entry is adequate (i.e., the entry screen does not time out prematurely). Ensure that the allowed text entry times are consistent with user needs.</li>
      <li>Provide clear, meaningful, and actionable feedback on entry errors to reduce user confusion and frustration. Significant usability implications arise when users have no way of knowing that they have entered text incorrectly.</li>
      <li>Allow at least 10 entry attempts for authenticators that require the entry of the authenticator output by the user. The longer and more complex the entry text, the greater the likelihood of user entry errors.</li>
      <li>Provide clear, meaningful feedback on the number of remaining allowed attempts. For rate limiting (i.e., throttling), inform users how long they have to wait until the next attempt.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Minimize the impact of form-factor constraints, such as limited touch and display areas on mobile devices:
    <ul>
      <li>Larger touch areas improve usability for text entry since typing on small devices is significantly more error-prone and time-consuming than typing on a full-size keyboard due to the size of the input mechanism (e.g., a finger) relative to the size of the on-screen target.</li>
      <li>Follow good user interface and information design for small displays.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Usability considerations for intermittent events (e.g., reauthentication, subscriber account lockout, expiration, revocation, damage, loss, theft, non-functional software) across authenticator types include the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Prompt users to perform some activity just before (e.g., two minutes before) an inactivity timeout would otherwise occur.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Prompt users to save their work before a fixed reauthentication timeout occurs, regardless of user activity.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Clearly communicate how and where to acquire technical assistance (e.g., provide users with a link to an online self-service feature, chat sessions, or a phone number for help desk support). Ideally, sufficient information can be provided to enable users to recover from intermittent events on their own without outside intervention.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Provide an accessible means for the subscriber to end their session (i.e., logoff).</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Subsequent sections describe usability considerations specific to a particular authenticator.</p>

    Passwords <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63b.html#passwordusability" class="header-link"><i class="fa fa-link"></i></a>
  
  
</h4>

<p><strong><em>Typical Usage</em></strong></p>

<p>Users often manually input the password (sometimes referred to as a passphrase or PIN). Alternatively, they may use a password manager to select a secure password and maintain distinct passwords for each authenticated service. The use of distinct passwords is important to avoid “password stuffing” attacks in which an attacker uses a compromised password from one site to access the user’s account on other sites. Agencies should carefully evaluate password managers before making recommendations or mandates to confirm that they meet expectations for secure implementation.</p>

<p>Usability considerations for typical usage without a password manager include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Memorability of the password
    <ul>
      <li>The likelihood of a recall failure increases if there are more items for users to remember. With fewer passwords, users can more easily recall the specific password needed for a particular RP.</li>
      <li>The memory burden is greater for a less frequently used password.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Usability considerations for typical usage with a password manager include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Ease of entry
    <ul>
      <li>Support autofill functionality to allow for the safe retrieval of secrets from password managers.</li>
      <li>Support copy and paste functionality in fields for entering passwords, including passphrases.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong><em>Intermittent Events</em></strong></p>

<p>Usability considerations for intermittent events include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>When users create and change passwords
    <ul>
      <li>Clearly communicate information on how to create and change passwords.</li>
      <li>Clearly communicate password requirements, as specified in <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63b.html#password">Sec. 3.1.1</a>.</li>
      <li>Allow at least 64 characters in length to support the use of passphrases. Encourage users to make passwords as lengthy as they want and use any characters that they like (including spaces) to aid memorization. Ensure that user interfaces support sufficient password lengths.</li>
      <li>Do not impose other composition rules (e.g., mixtures of different character types) on passwords.</li>
      <li>Do not require that passwords be changed arbitrarily (e.g., periodically) unless there is a user request or evidence of authenticator compromise (see <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63b.html#password">Sec. 3.1.1</a>).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Provide clear, meaningful, and actionable feedback when chosen passwords are rejected (e.g., when it appears on a “blocklist” of unacceptable passwords or has been used previously).</li>

</h4>

<p><strong><em>Typical Usage</em></strong></p>

<p>Subscribers use a printed or electronic authenticator to look up the appropriate secrets needed to respond to a verifier’s prompt. For example, a user may be asked to provide a specific subset of the numeric or character strings printed on a card in table format.</p>

<p>Usability considerations for typical usage include the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>User experience during entry of look-up secrets
    <ul>
      <li>Consider the complexity and size of the prompts. There are greater usability implications with larger subsets of secrets that a user is prompted to look up. Both the cognitive workload and physical difficulty for entry should be considered.</li>

</h4>

<p><strong><em>Typical Usage</em></strong></p>

<p>Out-of-band authentication requires that users have access to a primary and secondary communication channel.</p>

<p>Usability considerations for typical usage include the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Notify users of the receipt of a secret on a lockable device. If the out-of-band device is locked, authentication to the device should be required to access the secret.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Depending on the implementation, consider form-factor constraints, which are particularly problematic when users must enter text on mobile devices. Providing larger touch areas will improve usability for entering secrets on mobile devices.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Consider offering features that do not require text entry on mobile devices (e.g., a copy and paste feature), which are particularly helpful when the primary and secondary channels are on the same device. For example, it is difficult for users to transfer the authentication secret manually using a smartphone because they must switch back and forth — potentially multiple times — between the out-of-band application and the primary channel.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Messages and notifications to out-of-band devices should contain contextual information for the user, such as the name of the service being accessed.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Out-of-band messages should be delivered in a consistent manner and style to help the subscriber identify potentially suspicious authentication requests.</p>

</h4>

<p><strong><em>Typical Usage</em></strong></p>

<p>Users access the OTP generated by the single-factor OTP authenticator. The authenticator output is typically displayed on the authenticator, and the user enters it during the session being authenticated.</p>

<p>Usability considerations for typical usage include the following:</p>

</h4>

<p><strong><em>Typical Usage</em></strong></p>

<p>Users access the OTP generated by the multi-factor OTP authenticator through a second authentication factor. The OTP is typically displayed on the device, and the user manually enters it during the session being authenticated. The second authentication factor may be achieved through some kind of integral entry pad to enter a password or an integral biometric (e.g., fingerprint) reader. Usability considerations for the additional factor also apply (see <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63b.html#passwordusability">Sec. 8.1.2.1</a> for passwords and <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63b.html#biomusability">Sec. 8.1.4</a> for biometrics used in multi-factor authenticators).</p>

<p>Usability considerations for typical usage include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>User experience during manual entry of the authenticator output
    <ul>
      <li>For time-based OTPs, provide a grace period in addition to the time during which the OTP is displayed. Users need adequate time to enter the authenticator output, including looking back and forth between the multi-factor OTP authenticator and the entry screen.</li>
      <li>Consider form-factor constraints if users must unlock the multi-factor OTP authenticator via an integral entry pad or enter the authenticator output on mobile devices. Typing on small devices is significantly more error-prone and time-consuming than typing on a traditional keyboard. Providing larger touch areas improves usability for unlocking the multi-factor OTP authenticator or entering the authenticator output on mobile devices.</li>

    <p>Give cryptographic keys appropriately descriptive names that are meaningful to users so that they can recognize and recall which cryptographic key to use for which authentication task. This prevents users from having to deal with multiple similarly and ambiguously named cryptographic keys. Requiring the user to select from multiple cryptographic keys on smaller mobile devices may be particularly problematic if the names of the cryptographic keys are shortened due to reduced screen sizes.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Requiring a physical input (e.g., pressing a button) to operate a single-factor cryptographic authenticator could pose usability difficulties. For example, some USB ports are located on the back of computers, making it difficult for users to reach the port.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For connected authenticators, the limited availability of a direct computer interface (e.g., USB port) could pose usability difficulties. For example, laptop computers often have a limited number of USB ports, which may force users to unplug other USB peripherals to use the authenticator.</p>

<p><strong><em>Typical Usage</em></strong></p>

<p>To authenticate, users prove possession and control of the cryptographic key and control of the activation factor. Usability considerations for the additional factor also apply (see <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63b.html#passwordusability">Sec. 8.1.2.1</a> for passwords and <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63b.html#biomusability">Sec. 8.1.4</a> for biometrics used as activation factors).</p>

<p>Usability considerations for typical usage include the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Give cryptographic keys appropriately descriptive names that are meaningful to users so that they can recognize and recall which cryptographic key to use for which authentication task. This prevents users from having to deal with multiple similarly and ambiguously named cryptographic keys. Selecting from multiple cryptographic keys on smaller mobile devices may be particularly problematic if the names of the cryptographic keys are shortened due to reduced screen sizes.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Do not require users to keep external multi-factor cryptographic authenticators connected following authentication. Users may forget to disconnect the authenticator when they are done with it (e.g., forgetting a smartcard in the smartcard reader and walking away from the computer).
    <ul>
      <li>Users need to be informed about whether the authenticator is required to stay connected or not.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>For connected authenticators, the limited availability of a direct computer interface (e.g., USB port) could pose usability difficulties. For example, laptop computers often have a limited number of USB ports, which may force users to unplug other USB peripherals to use the authenticator.</li>

<p><a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63b.html#fig-3">Figure 3</a> summarizes the usability considerations for typical usage and intermittent events for each authenticator type. Many of the usability considerations for typical usage apply to most of the authenticator types, as demonstrated in the rows. The table highlights common and divergent usability characteristics across the authenticator types. Each column allows readers to easily identify the usability attributes to address for each authenticator. Depending on the users’ goals and context of use, certain attributes may be valued over others. Whenever possible, provide alternative authenticator types, and allow users to choose between them.</p>

<p>Multi-factor authenticators (e.g., multi-factor OTPs) also inherit their activation factor’s usability considerations.

<p>This section provides a high-level overview of general usability considerations for biometrics. A more detailed discussion of biometric usability can be found in <em>Usability &amp; Biometrics, Ensuring Successful Biometric Systems</em> <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63b.html#ref-use-and-bio">[UsabilityBiometrics]</a>.</p>

<p>User familiarity and practice with the device improve performance for all modalities. Device affordances (i.e., properties of a device that allow a user to perform an action), feedback, and clear instructions are critical to a user’s success with the biometric device. For example, provide clear instructions on the required actions for liveness detection. Ideally, users can select the modality that they are most comfortable with for their second authentication factor. Various user populations may be more comfortable, familiar with, and accepting of some biometric modalities than others. Provide meaningful feedback on the number of remaining allowed attempts. For example, for rate limiting (i.e., throttling), inform users of the time period they have to wait until their next attempt.</p>

<p><strong><em>Typical Usage</em></strong></p>

<p>The three biometric modalities that are most commonly used for authentication are fingerprint, facial comparison, and iris comparison.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Fingerprint usability considerations:
    <ul>
      <li>Users have to remember which fingers they used for initial enrollment.</li>
      <li>The amount of moisture on the finger affects the sensor’s ability for successful capture.</li>
      <li>Additional factors that influence fingerprint capture quality include age, sex, and occupation (e.g., users who handle chemicals or work extensively with their hands may have degraded friction ridges).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Facial comparison usability considerations:
    <ul>
      <li>Users have to remember whether they wore any artifacts (e.g., glasses) during enrollment, which affects facial recognition accuracy.</li>
      <li>Differences in environmental lighting conditions may affect facial recognition accuracy.</li>
      <li>Facial expressions affect facial recognition accuracy (e.g., smiling versus a neutral expression).</li>
      <li>Facial poses affect facial recognition accuracy (e.g., looking down or away from the camera).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Iris comparison usability considerations:
    <ul>
      <li>Wearing colored contacts may affect iris recognition accuracy.</li>
      <li>Users who have had eye surgery may need to re-enroll after surgery.</li>
      <li>Differences in environmental lighting conditions may affect iris recognition accuracy, especially for certain iris colors.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong><em>Intermittent Events</em></strong></p>

<p>Since biometrics are only permitted as a second factor for multi-factor authentication, usability considerations for intermittent events with the primary factor still apply. Intermittent events that may affect recognition accuracy using biometrics include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Degraded fingerprints or finger injuries</li>
  <li>Dirty, dry, or wet hands</li>
  <li>Wearing gloves or a mask</li>
  <li>Natural facial or weight changes over time</li>
  <li>Eye surgery</li>
</ul>

<p>Across all biometric modalities, usability considerations for intermittent events include the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>An alternative authentication method must be readily available and clearly communicated. Users should never be required to attempt biometric authentication and should be permitted to use a password as an alternative second factor.</li>
  <li>There should be provisions for technical assistance:
    <ul>
      <li>Clearly communicate information on how and where to acquire technical assistance. For example, provide users with a link to an online self-service feature or a phone number for help desk support. Ideally, provide sufficient information to enable users to recover from intermittent events on their own without outside intervention.</li>
      <li>Inform users of factors that may affect the sensitivity of the biometric sensor (e.g., cleanliness of the sensor).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<h2 id="customer-success" data-section="8">
  
  
    Customer Success Considerations <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63b.html#customer-success" class="header-link"><i class="fa fa-link"></i></a>
  
  
</h2>

<p>A primary aspect of customer experience is anticipating the needs of the user population and offering authenticator options that are suitable for that population. Some examples of authenticator suitability problems are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>SMS-based out-of-band authentication may not be usable for subscribers in rural areas without mobile phone service.</li>
  <li>OTP authenticators may be difficult to read for subscribers with vision issues.</li>
  <li>Out-of-band authentication secrets sent via a voice telephone call may be difficult to understand for subscribers with hearing issues.</li>
  <li>Some facial matching algorithms may not perform equally well for all user populations.</li>
  <li>Some subscribers may have conditions that interfere with fingerprint collection, such as missing fingers, degraded fingerprints (e.g., from working with chemicals or extensively using their hands), or dexterity problems.</li>
  <li>The cost of hardware-based authenticators may be beyond the means of some subscribers.</li>
  <li>Accurate manual entry of passwords may be difficult for subscribers with mobility and dexterity-related physical disabilities.</li>
  <li>Certain authenticator types may be challenging for subscribers with intellectual, developmental, learning, or neurocognitive difficulties.</li>
  <li>Lower-income subscribers are less likely to have up-to-date devices that are required by some authentication modes.</li>
  <li>Subscribers with less technological skill may need help to enter OTP codes from one device to another.</li>
  <li>The small form factor of some authenticators may pose challenges for certain users, such as senior citizens and individuals with dexterity challenges.</li>
</ul>

<p>While CSPs are required to mitigate common and expected problems in this area, it is not feasible to anticipate all potential customer experience problems, which will vary for different applications. Accordingly, CSPs need to provide mechanisms for subscribers to report challenges with authentication requirements and advise them on potential alternative authentication strategies.</p>

</h2>

<p>Passwords are a widely used form of authentication despite concerns about their use from both a usability and security standpoint <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63b.html#ref-persistence">[Persistence]</a>. Humans have a limited ability to memorize complex, arbitrary secrets, so they often choose passwords that can be easily guessed. To address the resultant security concerns, online services have introduced rules that increase the effective strength of these passwords. The most notable form is composition rules, which require users to choose passwords that are constructed using a mix of character types (e.g., at least one digit, uppercase letter, and symbol). However, analyses of breached password databases reveal that the benefit of such rules is less significant than initially thought <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63b.html#ref-policies">[Policies]</a>, and the impacts on usability and memorability are severe.</p>

<p>The effective strength of user-chosen passwords has often been characterized using the information theory concept of entropy <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63b.html#ref-shannon">[Shannon]</a>. While entropy can be readily calculated for data with deterministic distribution functions, estimating entropy for user-chosen passwords is challenging. For this reason, a different and somewhat more straightforward approach based primarily on password length is presented herein. The use of passphrases (i.e., passwords with multiple words) is often an effective way to create a longer password.</p>

<p>Many attacks associated with passwords are not affected by password complexity and length. Keystroke logging, phishing, and social engineering attacks are equally effective on lengthy and complex passwords as they are on simple ones. These attacks are outside of the scope of this Appendix.</p>
<h2 id="length" data-section="A">
  
  
    Length <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63b.html#length" class="header-link"><i class="fa fa-link"></i></a>
  
  
</h2>

<p>Password length is a primary factor in characterizing password strength <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63b.html#ref-strength">[Strength]</a> <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63b.html#ref-composition">[Composition]</a>. Passwords that are too short yield to brute-force attacks and dictionary attacks. The minimum password length required depends on the threat model being addressed. Online attacks in which the attacker attempts to log in by guessing the password can be mitigated by limiting the permitted login attempt rate. To prevent an attacker (or a persistent claimant with poor typing skills) from quickly inflicting a denial-of-service attack on the subscriber by making many incorrect guesses, passwords need to be complex enough that a reasonable number of attempts can be permitted with a low probability of a successful guess, and rate limiting, as described in <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/3_authentictors.md#throttle">Sec. 3.2.2</a> can be applied before there is a significant chance of a successful guess.</p>

<p>Offline attacks are possible when the attacker obtains one or more hashed passwords through a database breach. The ability of the attacker to determine one or more users’ passwords depends on how the password is stored. Commonly, passwords are salted with a random value and hashed, preferably using a computationally expensive algorithm. Even with such measures, the current ability of attackers to compute many billions of hashes per second in an offline environment that is not subject to rate limiting requires passwords to be orders of magnitude more complex than those expected to resist only online attacks.</p>

<p>Users should be encouraged to make their passwords as long as they want within reason. Since the size of a hashed password is independent of its length, there is no reason to prohibit the use of lengthy passwords (or passphrases) if the user wishes. However, extremely long passwords (perhaps megabytes long) could require excessive processing time to hash, so it is reasonable to have some limit.</p>
<h2 id="complexity" data-section="A">
  
  
    Complexity <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63b.html#complexity" class="header-link"><i class="fa fa-link"></i></a>
  
  
</h2>

<p>Composition rules are commonly used in an attempt to increase the difficulty of guessing user-chosen passwords. However, research has shown that users respond in very predictable ways to the requirements imposed by composition rules <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63b.html#ref-policies">[Policies]</a>. For example, a user who might have chosen “password” as their password would be relatively likely to choose “Password1” if required to include an uppercase letter and a number or “Password1!” if a symbol is also required.</p>

<p>Users also express frustration when online services reject their attempts to create complex passwords. Many services reject passwords with spaces and various special characters. Characters that are not accepted are sometimes the result of an effort to avoid attacks that depend on those characters (e.g., SQL injection). However, an unhashed password would not be sent intact to a database, so such precautions are unnecessary. Users should also be able to include space characters to allow the use of phrases. Repeated space characters add little to the effective strength of passwords and may introduce usability issues (e.g., the undetected use of two spaces rather than one), so removing repeated spaces in typed passwords may be beneficial if initial verification fails.</p>

<p>Since users’ password choices are often predictable, attackers are likely to guess passwords that have previously proven successful. These include dictionary words and passwords from previous breaches, such as the “Password1!” example above. For this reason, passwords chosen by users should be compared against a blocklist of unacceptable passwords. This list should include passwords from previous breach corpuses, dictionary words used as passwords, and specific words (e.g., the name of the service itself) that users are likely to choose. Since a minimum length requirement will also govern the user’s choice of passwords, this dictionary only needs to include entries that meet that requirement. As noted in <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63b.html#passwordver">Sec. 3.1.1.2</a>, it is not beneficial for the blocklist to be excessively large or comprehensive, since its primary purpose is to prevent the use of very common passwords that might be guessed in an online attack before throttling restrictions take effect. An excessively large blocklist will likely frustrate users who attempt to choose a memorable password.</p>

<p>Highly complex passwords introduce a new potential vulnerability: they are less likely to be memorable and more likely to be written down or stored electronically in an unsafe manner. While these practices are not necessarily vulnerable, some methods of recording such secrets will be. This is an additional motivation for not requiring excessively long or complex passwords.</p>
<h2 id="central-vs-local-verification" data-section="A">
  
  
    Central vs. Local Verification <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63b.html#central-vs-local-verification" class="header-link"><i class="fa fa-link"></i></a>
  
  
</h2>

<p>While passwords that are used as a separate authentication factor are often centrally verified by the CSP’s verifier, those that are used as an activation factor for a multi-factor authenticator are either verified locally by the authenticator or used to derive the authenticator output, which will be incorrect if the wrong activation factor is used. Both of these situations are referred to as “local verification.”</p>

<p>The attack surfaces and vulnerabilities for central and local verification are very different. Accordingly, the requirements for centrally verified passwords differ from those verified locally. Centrally verified passwords require the verifier (i.e., an online resource) to store salted and iteratively hashed verification secrets for all of the subscribers’ passwords. Although the salting and hashing process increases the computational effort to determine the passwords from the hashes, the verifier is an attractive target for attackers, particularly those interested in compromising an arbitrary subscriber rather than a specific one.</p>

<p>Local verifiers do not have the same concerns with large-scale attacks on a central online verifier but depend on the physical security of the authenticator and the integrity of its associated endpoint. To the extent that the authenticator stores the activation factor, that factor must be protected against physical and <em>side-channel</em> (e.g., power and timing analysis) attacks on the authenticator. When the activation factor is entered through the associated endpoint, the endpoint needs to be free of malware (e.g., key-logging software). Since such threats are less dependent on the length and complexity of the password, these requirements are relaxed for local verification.</p>

<p>Online password-guessing attacks are a similar threat to centrally and locally verified passwords. Throttling is the primary defense against online attacks and can be particularly challenging for local verifiers because of the limited ability of some authenticators to securely store information about unsuccessful attempts. Throttling of local activation factors can be done in one of two ways. The authenticator itself could handle the throttling by keeping count of invalid activation attempts or, when activated incorrectly, the authenticator could produce an invalid authenticator output that will be rejected and throttled by the verifier.</p>

</h2>

<p>Length and complexity requirements beyond those recommended here significantly increase user frustration and the difficulty of using passwords. As a result, users often work around these restrictions counterproductively. Other mitigations (e.g., blocklists, secure hashed storage, machine-generated random passwords, rate limiting) are more effective at preventing modern brute-force attacks, so no additional password requirements are imposed.</p>

<p>The ability to “sync” authenticators — specifically to copy (i.e., clone) their authentication secrets to the cloud and thence to additional authenticators — is a relatively new development in authentication. This appendix provides additional guidelines on the use of syncable authenticators.</p>

<p>In some cases, authentication keys may be stored in a sync fabric (e.g., cloud storage). This allows the keys to be backed up and transferred to other devices. The following requirements apply to keys that are managed in this manner:</p>

<p>The following additional requirements apply to federal enterprise<sup id="fnref:fed" role="doc-noteref"><a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63b.html#fn:fed" class="footnote">1</a></sup> use of syncable authenticators:</p>

</h2>

<p>Many syncable authenticators are built on W3C’s <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63b.html#ref-WebAuthn">[WebAuthn]</a> specification, which provides a common data structure, a challenge-response cryptographic protocol, and an API for leveraging public-key credentials. The specification is flexible and adaptive, meaning that not all deployments of WebAuthn credentials will meet the requirements of federal agencies for implementation.</p>

<p>The specification has a series of flags that the RP application can request from the authenticator to provide additional context for the authentication event and determine whether it meets the RP’s access policies. This section describes certain flags in the WebAuthn specification that federal agencies acting as RPs should understand and interrogate when building their syncable authenticator implementations to align with AAL2 guidelines.</p>

<p>The following requirements apply to WebAuthn Level 3 flags:</p>

<dl>
  <dt>User Present (UP)</dt>
  <dd>The User Present flag indicates that a “presence” test confirmed that the user has interacted with the authenticator (e.g., tapping a hardware token inserted into a USB port). This supports authentication intent, as described in <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63b.html#intent">Sec. 3.2.8</a>. Verifiers <strong class="normative">SHOULD</strong> confirm that the User Present flag has been set.</dd>
  <dt>User Verified (UV)</dt>
  <dd>The User Verified flag indicates that the authenticator has locally authenticated the user using one of the available “user verification” methods. Verifiers <strong class="normative">SHALL</strong> indicate that UV is preferred and <strong class="normative">SHALL</strong> inspect responses to confirm the value of the UV flag. This indicates whether the authenticator can be treated as a multi-factor cryptographic authenticator. If the user is not verified, agencies <strong class="normative">SHALL</strong> treat the authenticator as a single-factor cryptographic authenticator. A further extension to the WebAuthn Level 3 specification (see Sec. 10.3 of <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63b.html#ref-WebAuthn">[WebAuthn]</a>) provides additional data on verification methods if agencies seek to gain context on the local authentication event.</dd>
  <dt>Backup Eligible</dt>
  <dd>The Backup Eligible flag indicates whether the authenticator can be synced to a different device (i.e., whether the key can be stored elsewhere). It is important to note that just because an authenticator <em>can</em> be synced does not mean that it <em>has</em> been synced. Verifiers <strong class="normative">MAY</strong> use this flag to establish policies that restrict the use of syncable authenticators. This flag is necessary to distinguish authenticators that are device-bound from those that may be cloned to more than one device.</dd>
  <dt>Backup State</dt>
  <dd>The Backup State flag indicates whether an authenticator <em>has</em> been synced to a different device. Verifiers <strong class="normative">MAY</strong> use this flag to establish restrictions on authenticators that are synced to other devices. Agencies <strong class="normative">SHOULD NOT</strong> condition acceptance based on this flag for public-facing applications due to user experience concerns.</dd>
</dl>

<p>In addition to the flags specified above, agencies may wish to gain additional information on the origins and capabilities of the syncable authenticators that they choose to implement and accept. Within the context of WebAuthn, some authenticators support attestation features that can be used to determine the capabilities and manufacturers of specific authenticators. For federal enterprise use cases, agencies <strong class="normative">SHOULD</strong> implement attestation capabilities based on the functionality offered by their platform providers. This would take the form of a manufacturer attestation in which the RP requests identifying information about the authenticator.</p>

<p>The unavailability of attestations <strong class="normative">SHOULD NOT</strong> block the use of syncable authenticators for broad public-facing applications. Due to the limited availability of attestations in consumer products, requiring their use is likely to divert users to less secure authentication options that are vulnerable to phishing (e.g., PSTN-based out-of-band authentication). While authentication transaction metadata (e.g., the User Verified flag indicating the use of a local activation factor) is available in WebAuthn responses, attestation can provide stronger assurance of the characteristics of the authenticator used in a transaction.  RPs <strong class="normative">SHOULD</strong> use attestation to determine the level of confidence they have in a syncable authenticator when attestations are available.</p>

<p>When the RP receives flag and attestation data, the authenticator may provide information that is incomplete or inconsistent with access to a resource. Agencies <strong class="normative">SHALL</strong> evaluate the use cases for syncable authenticators and determine the appropriate access policy decisions that they intend to make based on the returned information.</p>
<h2 id="sharing" data-section="B">

</h2>

<p>Cybersecurity guidelines have historically cautioned against sharing authenticators between users. Rather, different users are expected to maintain their own unique authenticators. Despite this, authenticator and password sharing occurs within some user groups and applications to allow individuals to share access to a digital account.</p>

<p>As indicated in <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63b.html#table-5">Table 5</a>, some syncable authenticator implementations have embraced this user behavior and established methods for sharing authentication keys between different users. Further, some implementations actively encourage sharing syncable authenticators as a convenient and more secure alternative to sharing passwords for common services.</p>

<p>For enterprise use cases, concerns over sharing keys can be effectively mitigated using device management techniques that limit the ability for keys to be moved off of approved devices or sync fabrics. However, similar mitigations are not currently available for public-facing use cases, leaving RPs dependent on the sharing models adopted by syncable authenticator providers. Owners of public-facing applications should be aware of the risks associated with shared authenticators. When interacting with the public, agencies have limited visibility into which specific authenticators are being employed by their users and should assume that all syncable authenticators may be subject to sharing. While many sharing models have substantial controls that minimize risks (e.g., requiring close proximity between devices to allow sharing), other implementations are less restrictive.</p>

<p>The risk of sharing posed by this new class of authenticators is not unique. It applies to all authenticator types, some of which are weaker than syncable authenticators. Any authenticator can be shared by a user who is determined to share it. Users can actively share passwords, OTPs, out-of-band authenticators, and even push-based authentication events that allow a designee (whether formal or not) to authenticate on behalf of an end user.</p>

<p>Agencies determine which authenticators they will accept for their applications based on the specific risks, threats, and usability considerations they face. Syncable authenticators may be offered as a new option for applications that seek to implement up to AAL2. The trade-offs of this technology should be balanced with expected outcomes for security, privacy, and user experience.</p>

</h2>

<p>A common use of syncable authenticators is in an AAL2 authentication transaction. The following items summarize how WebAuthn syncable authenticators satisfy aspects of AAL2 requirements:</p>

<dl>
  <dt>Phishing resistance (recommended, required for federal enterprise)</dt>
  <dd><strong>Achieved</strong>: Properly configured syncable authenticators create a unique public or private key pair whose use is constrained to the domain in which it was created (i.e., the key can only be used with a specific website or RP). This prevents a falsified web page from being able to capture and reuse an authenticator output.</dd>
  <dt>Replay resistance (required)</dt>
  <dd><strong>Achieved</strong>: Syncable authenticators prevent replay resistance (i.e., prevention of reuse in future transactions) through a random nonce that is incorporated into each authentication transaction.</dd>
  <dt>Authentication intent (required)</dt>
  <dd><strong>Achieved</strong>: Syncable authenticators require users to present an activation factor (i.e., activation secret, biometric characteristic) to initiate the cryptographic authentication protocol. This serves as authentication intent, as the event cannot proceed without the user’s active participation.</dd>
  <dt>Multi-factor (required)</dt>
  <dd><strong>Achieved</strong>: The User Verified flag value indicates whether a local authentication mechanism (i.e., an activation factor) was used to complete the transaction. Without user verification, the verifier prompts for an additional authentication factor as part of the transaction.</dd>
</dl>

<p>If the subscriber provides their own authenticator, the verifier may have limited visibility into the features and capabilities of the sync fabric and the devices to which the user may sync their authentication keys. In this scenario, the verifier <strong class="normative">SHOULD</strong> leverage additional risk indicators or trust signals that may be available from the transaction, device, or sync fabric to increase confidence in the authentication event.</p>

<p>Syncable authenticators are not unique in this respect. Any subscriber-provided authenticator is subject to the same risks as syncable authenticators, including OTP authenticators and nearly all out-of-band authenticators. It is important for CSPs and IdPs to assess each type of authenticator that they offer at each assurance level and determine which are acceptable based on their users and transaction types.</p>

<p><em>This section is informative.</em></p>

<p>A wide variety of terms are used in the realm of digital identity. While many definitions are consistent with earlier versions of SP 800-63, some have changed in this revision. Many of these terms lack a single, consistent definition, warranting careful attention to how the terms are defined here.</p>

<dl>
  <dt>account recovery</dt>
  <dd>The ability to regain ownership of a <em>subscriber account</em> and its associated information and privileges.</dd>
  <dt>activation</dt>
  <dd>The process of inputting an <em>activation factor</em> into a <em>multi-factor authenticator</em> to enable its use for <em>authentication</em>.</dd>
  <dt>activation factor</dt>
  <dd>An additional <em>authentication factor</em> that is used to enable successful <em>authentication</em> with a <em>multi-factor authenticator</em>.</dd>
  <dt>activation secret</dt>
  <dd>A <em>password</em> that is used locally as an <em>activation factor</em> for a <em>multi-factor authenticator</em>.</dd>
  <dt>applicant</dt>
  <dd>A <em>subject</em> undergoing the processes of <em>identity proofing</em> and <em>enrollment</em>.</dd>
  <dt>approved cryptography</dt>
  <dd>An encryption algorithm, <em>hash function</em>, random bit generator, or similar technique that is <em>Federal Information Processing Standards</em> (FIPS)-approved or NIST-recommended. Approved algorithms and techniques are either specified or adopted in a FIPS or NIST recommendation.</dd>
  <dt>assertion</dt>
  <dd>A statement from an <em>IdP</em> to an <em>RP</em> that contains information about an authentication event for a <em>subscriber</em>. Assertions can also contain identity <em>attributes</em> for the subscriber in the form of attribute values, derived attribute values, and attribute bundles.</dd>
  <dt>asymmetric keys</dt>
  <dd>Two related <em>cryptographic keys</em> comprised of a <em>public key</em> and a <em>private key</em> that are used to perform complementary operations, such as encryption and decryption or signature verification and generation.</dd>
  <dt>attestation</dt>
  <dd>Information conveyed to the <em>CSP</em>, generally at the time that an <em>authenticator</em> is bound, to describe the characteristics of a connected authenticator or the <em>endpoint</em> involved in an authentication operation.</dd>
  <dt>attribute</dt>
  <dd>A quality or characteristic ascribed to someone or something. An identity attribute is an attribute about the identity of a <em>subscriber</em> (e.g., name, date of birth, address).</dd>
  <dt>attribute validation</dt>
  <dd>The process or act of confirming that a set of <em>attributes</em> are accurate and associated with a real-life identity. See <em>validation</em>.</dd>
  <dt>authenticate</dt>
  <dd>See <em>authentication</em>.</dd>
  <dt>authenticated protected channel</dt>
  <dd>An encrypted communication channel that uses <em>approved cryptography</em> in which the connection initiator (client) has <em>authenticated</em> the recipient (server). Authenticated protected channels are encrypted to provide confidentiality and protection against active intermediaries and are frequently used in the user <em>authentication</em> process. <em>Transport Layer Security</em> (TLS) and Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63b.html#ref-RFC9325">[RFC9325]</a> are examples of authenticated protected channels in which the certificate presented by the recipient is verified by the initiator. Unless otherwise specified, authenticated protected channels do not require the server to authenticate the client. Authentication of the server is often accomplished through a certificate chain that leads to a trusted root rather than individually with each server.</dd>
  <dt>authenticated session</dt>
  <dd>See <em>protected session</em>.</dd>
  <dt>authentication</dt>
  <dd>The process by which a <em>claimant</em> proves possession and control of one or more <em>authenticators</em> bound to a <em>subscriber account</em> to demonstrate that they are the <em>subscriber</em> associated with that account.</dd>
  <dt>authentication assurance level (AAL)</dt>
  <dd>A category that describes the strength of the <em>authentication</em> process.</dd>
  <dt>authentication factor</dt>
  <dd>The three types of authentication factors are <em>something you know</em>, <em>something you have</em>, and <em>something you are</em>. Every <em>authenticator</em> has one or more authentication factors.</dd>
  <dt>authentication intent</dt>
  <dd>The process of confirming the <em>claimant’s</em> intent to <em>authenticate</em> or reauthenticate by requiring user intervention in the authentication flow. Some <em>authenticators</em> (e.g., OTPs) establish authentication intent as part of their operation. Others require a specific step to establish intent, such as pressing a button. Authentication intent is a countermeasure against malware at the <em>endpoint</em> as a proxy for authenticating an attacker without the <em>subscriber</em>’s knowledge.</dd>
  <dt>authentication key</dt>
  <dd>A private or symmetric key used by an authenticator to generate the authenticator output.</dd>
  <dt>authentication protocol</dt>
  <dd>A defined sequence of messages between a <em>claimant</em> and a <em>verifier</em> that demonstrates that the claimant has possession and control of one or more valid <em>authenticators</em> to establish their identity and, optionally, demonstrates that the claimant is communicating with the intended verifier.</dd>
  <dt>authentication secret</dt>
  <dd>A generic term for any secret value that is used to verify the <em>subscriber</em> in an <em>authentication protocol</em>. These are further divided into <em>short-term authentication secrets</em>, which are only useful to an attacker for a limited period of time, and <em>long-term authentication secrets</em>, which allow an attacker to impersonate the subscriber until they are manually reset. The <em>authenticator</em> secret is the canonical example of a long-term authentication secret, while the <em>authenticator output</em> — if it is different from the authenticator secret — is usually a short-term authentication secret.</dd>
  <dt>authenticator</dt>
  <dd>Something that the <em>subscriber</em> possesses and controls (e.g., a <em>cryptographic module</em> or <em>password</em>) and that is used to <em>authenticate</em> a <em>claimant’s</em> identity. See <em>authenticator type</em> and <em>multi-factor authenticator</em>.</dd>
  <dt>authenticator binding</dt>
