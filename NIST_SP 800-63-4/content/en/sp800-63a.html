</h1>

<p>This guideline focuses on identity proofing and enrollment for use in digital authentication. During the process of identity proofing, an applicant provides evidence to a credential service provider (CSP) reliably identifying themselves, thereby allowing the CSP to assert that identification at a useful identity assurance level. This document defines technical requirements for each of three identity assurance levels. The guidelines are not intended to constrain the development or use of standards outside of this purpose. This publication supersedes NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-63A.</p>

<p><em>This section is informative.</em></p>

<p>One of the challenges of providing online services is being able to associate a set of activities with a single known individual. Situations in which it is important to reliably establish an association with a real-life subject include accessing sensitive government services, executing financial transactions, when required by regulation (e.g., the financial industry’s Customer Identification Program requirements), and when needed to establish accountability for high-risk actions (e.g., changing the release rate of water from a dam).</p>

<p>These guidelines define identity proofing as the process of establishing a relationship between a subject accessing online services and a real-life person to some degree of assurance. For the purposes of this document, the terms “subject” and “person” refer only to natural persons, not non-person entities, organizations, or things. This document provides guidance for federal agencies, third-party Credential Service Providers (CSPs), and other organizations that provide or use identity proofing services.</p>

    Expected Outcomes of Identity Proofing <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63a.html#expected-outcomes-of-identity-proofing" class="header-link"><i class="fa fa-link"></i></a>
  
  
</h2>

<p>The expected outcomes of identity proofing include:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Identity resolution</strong>: Determine that the claimed identity corresponds to a single, unique individual within the context of the population of users served by the CSP or online service.</li>
  <li><strong>Evidence validation</strong>: Confirm that supplied identity evidence is genuine, authentic, and accurate.</li>
  <li><strong>Attribute validation</strong>: Confirm the accuracy of the core attributes, which are the minimum set of attributes required to complete identity proofing and provide services.</li>
  <li><strong>Identity verification</strong>: Confirm that the applicant is the genuine owner of the presented evidence and attributes.</li>
  <li><strong>Identity enrollment</strong>: Enroll the identity-proofed applicant into the CSP’s identity service as a subscriber.</li>
  <li><strong>Fraud mitigation</strong>: Detect, respond to, and prevent access to benefits, services, data, or assets using a fraudulent identity.</li>
</ul>

<p>Identity proofing services are expected to incorporate privacy-enhancing principles (e.g., data minimization) and employ good usability practices to minimize the burden on applicants while still accomplishing the expected outcomes.</p>

    Identity Assurance Levels <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63a.html#identity-assurance-levels" class="header-link"><i class="fa fa-link"></i></a>
  
  
</h2>

<p>Assurance (confidence) in a subscriber’s identity is established using the processes associated with the identity assurance levels (IAL) defined in these guidelines. Each successive IAL builds on the requirements of lower IALs in order to achieve increased assurance.</p>

<p><strong>No identity proofing</strong>: There is no requirement to link the applicant to a specific, real-life person. Evidence collection is not required; attributes may or may not be validated; and identity verification is not conducted. This does not exclude attributes from being validated as part of other business processes, but attribute validation is not required for access.</p>

<p><strong>IAL1</strong>: The identity proofing process supports the real-world existence of the claimed identity and provides some assurance that the applicant is associated with that identity. Core attributes are obtained from identity evidence or self-asserted by the applicant.  All core attributes (see <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63a.html#CoreAttributes">Sec. 2.2</a>) are validated against authoritative or credible sources, and steps are taken to confirm that the attributes are associated with the person undergoing the identity proofing process. Identity proofing is performed using remote or on-site processes, with or without the attendance of a CSP representative. Upon the successful completion of identity proofing, the applicant is enrolled into a subscriber account and any authenticators can then be bound to the account, including subscriber-provided authenticators. IAL1 is designed to limit highly scalable attacks (e.g., automated enrollment attacks) and to protect against synthetic identities and attacks using compromised personal information.</p>

<p><strong>IAL2</strong>: IAL2 requires collecting additional evidence and more rigorous processes for validating evidence and verifying identities, including enhanced processes to confirm that the applicant is the rightful owner of the presented evidence. Like IAL1, identity proofing at IAL2 can be performed using remote or on-site processes, with or without the attendance of a CSP representative. In addition to those threats addressed by IAL1, IAL2 is designed to limit scaled and targeted attacks and to protect against basic evidence falsification, evidence theft, and social engineering tactics.</p>

<p><strong>IAL3</strong>: IAL3 adds the requirements for a trained CSP representative (i.e., proofing agent) to interact directly with the applicant as part of an on-site attended identity proofing session and the collection of at least one biometric characteristic. The successful on-site identity proofing session concludes with the enrollment of the applicant into a subscriber account and the delivery of one or more authenticators bound to that account. IAL3 is designed to limit more sophisticated attacks, and protect against advanced evidence falsification, theft, repudiation, and more advanced social engineering tactics.</p>

</h1>

<p><em>This section is normative.</em></p>

<p>This section provides an overview of the identity proofing and enrollment process, as well as requirements to support the resolution, validation, and verification of the identity claimed by an applicant. It also provides guidelines on additional aspects of the identity proofing process.  These requirements are intended to ensure that the claimed identity exists in the real world and that the applicant is the individual associated with that identity.</p>

<p>These guidelines provide multiple methods by which resolution, validation, and verification can be accomplished, as well as multiple types of identity evidence that support the identity proofing process. CSPs and organizations <strong class="normative">SHOULD</strong> provide options when implementing their identity proofing services and processes to promote access for applicants with different means, capabilities, and technologies. These options <strong class="normative">SHOULD</strong> include accepting multiple types and combinations of identity evidence, supporting multiple data validation sources, enabling multiple methods for verifying identity, providing multiple identity proofing types, and offering exception handling for applicants (e.g., trusted referees, applicant references).</p>

<p>CSPs <strong class="normative">SHALL</strong> evaluate the risks associated with each identity proofing option offered (e.g., identity proofing types, validation sources, assistance mechanisms) and implement mitigating fraud controls, as appropriate. At a minimum, CSPs <strong class="normative">SHALL</strong> design each option such that the options provide comparable assurance in aggregate.</p>

<p>Requirements are typically expressed in these guidelines as responsibilities of the CSP unless otherwise noted. CSP requirements may be performed by a single entity or may include several component services so that all CSP responsibilities are fulfilled.</p>

</h2>

<p>The intent of identity proofing is to ensure that the applicant involved in the identity proofing process is who they claim to be to a stated level of confidence. This document presents a three-step process for CSPs to identity-proof applicants at designated assurance levels. The first step is identity resolution, which consists of collecting appropriate identity evidence and attribute information to determine whether the applicant is a unique identity in the population served by the CSP and a real-life person. The second step is identity validation, which confirms the authenticity, accuracy, and validity of the evidence and attribute information collected in the first step. The third step is identity verification, which confirms that the applicant presenting the identity evidence is the same individual to whom the evidence was issued. In most cases, upon successfully identity proofing an applicant to the designated IAL, the CSP establishes a unique subscriber account for the applicant (now a subscriber in the identity service), which allows one or more authenticators to be bound to the proven identity in the account.</p>

<p>Identity proofing can be part of an organization’s business processes to determine the suitability or entitlement to a benefit or service, though such determinations are outside of the scope of these guidelines.</p>

<p><em>This subsection is informative.</em></p>

<p><a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63a.html#fig-1">Figure 1</a> provides an illustrative example of the three-step identity proofing process.</p>

<p>The following steps present a common workflow example of remote unattended identity proofing and are not intended to represent a normative processing workflow model.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Resolution</strong></p>

    <ul>
      <li>The CSP collects one or two pieces of identity evidence of appropriate strength.</li>
      <li>The CSP collects any additional core attributes, as needed, from the applicant to supplement those contained in the presented identity evidence.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Validation</strong></p>

    <ul>
      <li>The CSP confirms that the presented evidence is authentic, accurate, and valid.</li>
      <li>The CSP validates the attributes obtained in step 1 by checking them against authoritative or credible validation sources, as described in <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63a.html#ValidSources">Sec. 2.4.2.4</a>.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Verification</strong></p>

    <ul>
      <li>The CSP employs an approved identity verification process to confirm that the applicant is the genuine owner of the presented identity evidence.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Enrollment</strong></p>

    <p>Upon the successful completion of the three identity proofing steps, a notification of proofing is sent to a validated address, and the applicant can be enrolled into a subscriber account with the CSP, as described in <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63a.html#accounts">Sec. 5</a>. A subscriber account includes at least one validated address (e.g., phone number, mailing address) that can be used to communicate with the subscriber about their account. Additionally, one or more authenticators are bound to the proven identity in the subscriber account.</p>
  </li>
</ol>
<h3 id="ProofingRoles" data-section="2">
  
  
    Identity Proofing Roles <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63a.html#ProofingRoles" class="header-link"><i class="fa fa-link"></i></a>
  
  
</h3>

<p>Different individuals can play different roles within the proofing process. To support the consistent implementation of these guidelines, the following identity proofing roles are defined:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Proofing agent</strong>: An agent of the CSP who is vetted and trained to attend on-site or remote identity proofing sessions and make limited, risk-based decisions (e.g., visually inspecting identity evidence and determining it has not been altered). See <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63a.html#authenticity-checks">Sec. 3.13</a> for minimum training requirements for proofing agents.</li>
  <li><strong>Trusted referee</strong>: An agent of the CSP, a third-party service, or a <em>relying party</em> (RP) who is vetted and trained to make risk-based decisions regarding an applicant’s identity proofing case when that applicant is unable to meet the expected requirements of a defined IAL proofing process. Requirements for trusted referees are contained in <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63a.html#TRs">Sec. 3.15.1</a>. In contrast to proofing agents, trusted referees receive additional training and resources to support exception handling scenarios, including when applicants do not possess the required identity evidence or the attributes on the evidence do not all match the claimed identity (e.g., due to a recent name or address change).</li>
  <li><strong>Applicant reference</strong>: A representative of the applicant who can vouch for the identity of the applicant, specific attributes related to the applicant, or conditions relative to the context of the individual (e.g., emergency status, homelessness). An applicant reference does not act on behalf of the applicant in the identity proofing process but can support claims of identity. Requirements for applicant references are contained in <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63a.html#ARs">Sec. 3.15.3</a>.</li>
  <li><strong>Process assistant</strong>: An individual who provides support services (e.g., translation, transcription, or accessibility support) to assist the applicant in the identity proofing process but does not support decision-making or risk-based evaluation. Since the process assistant is not involved in decision-making there are no requirements in these guidelines for this role.</li>
</ul>

<p>CSPs <strong class="normative">SHALL</strong> identify which of the above roles are applicable to their identity service and <strong class="normative">SHALL</strong> provide training and support resources consistent with the requirements and expectations provided in <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63a.html#ial-general">Sec. 3</a>.</p>
<h3 id="ProofingTypes" data-section="2">
  
  
    Identity Proofing Types <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63a.html#ProofingTypes" class="header-link"><i class="fa fa-link"></i></a>
  
  
</h3>

<p>For the purposes of this document, identity proofing types are defined by the combination of technologies, communication channels, and identity proofing roles employed by a CSP. Identity proofing types are characterized based on two factors: where the identity proofing takes place and whether the process is attended by an agent of the CSP.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Remote unattended identity proofing</strong>: Identity proofing conducted where the resolution, validation, and verification processes are completely automated, and interaction with a proofing agent or trusted referee is not required.  The location and devices used in the proofing process are not controlled by the CSP.</li>
  <li><strong>Remote attended identity proofing</strong>: Identity proofing conducted where the applicant completes resolution, validation, and verification steps through a secure video session with a proofing agent or trusted referee. The location and devices used in the proofing process are not controlled by the CSP.</li>
  <li><strong>On-site unattended identity proofing</strong>: Identity proofing conducted where an individual interacts with a controlled workstation or kiosk, but interaction with a proofing agent or trusted referee is not required. The process is fully automated but at a physical location and on devices controlled by the CSP.</li>
  <li><strong>On-site attended identity proofing</strong>: Identity proofing conducted in a physical setting where the applicant completes the entire identity proofing process (i.e., resolution, validation, and verification) in the presence of a proofing agent or trusted referee. The proofing agent or trusted referee can be co-located with the user or interact with the user via a kiosk or device. The physical location and devices are controlled by the CSP.</li>
</ul>

<p>The requirements at each assurance level are structured to allow CSPs to implement different combinations of identity proofing types to meet the requirements of different assurance levels, as appropriate. CSPs <strong class="normative">SHOULD</strong> offer the combination of identity proofing types that best addresses the needs of the populations served by their identity service and the risk posture of the RPs that use their service.</p>
<h2 id="CoreAttributes" data-section="2">
  
  
    Core Attributes <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63a.html#CoreAttributes" class="header-link"><i class="fa fa-link"></i></a>
  
  
</h2>

<p>The identity proofing process involves the presentation and validation of the minimum attributes necessary to accomplish identity proofing, including what is needed to complete resolution, validation, and verification. The CSP determines and documents the set of attributes that it considers to be core attributes, as specified in <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63a.html#DocRecReqs">Sec. 3.1</a>. CSPs <strong class="normative">SHALL</strong> include a government identifier<sup id="fnref:GovID" role="doc-noteref"><a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63a.html#fn:GovID" class="footnote">1</a></sup> and <strong class="normative">SHOULD</strong> include the following in their set of core attributes for identity proofing at any IAL:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>First name</strong>: The applicant’s given name.</li>
  <li><strong>Middle name or initial</strong>: The applicant’s middle name or initial, as applicable.</li>
  <li><strong>Last name</strong>: The applicant’s last name or family name, as appropriate.</li>
  <li><strong>Date of birth</strong>: The date on which the applicant was born.</li>
  <li><strong>Physical or digital address</strong>: A physical (i.e., mailing address) or digital (e.g., phone number or email) address at which the applicant can receive communications related to the proofing process.</li>
</ul>

<p>Additional attributes <strong class="normative">MAY</strong> be added to these as required by the CSP and RP. The CSP and RP <strong class="normative">SHALL</strong> document all core attributes in trust agreements and practice statements. Following a privacy risk assessment, a CSP <strong class="normative">MAY</strong> request additional attributes that are not required to complete identity proofing, but that may support other RP business processes. See <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63a.html#PrivacyReqs">Sec. 3.3</a> for details on privacy requirements for requesting additional attributes.</p>

</h2>

<p>Identity resolution involves the CSP’s collection of the minimum amount of identity evidence and attribute information that is needed for identity proofing and to distinguish a unique identity in the population served. Identity resolution is the starting point in the overall identity proofing process, including the initial detection of potential fraud.</p>

</h2>

<p>Identity evidence is information or documentation that supports the real-world existence of the claimed identity. Identity evidence may be physical (e.g., a driver’s license) or digital (e.g., a mobile driver’s license or digital assertion).</p>

<p>Identity evidence collection supports the identity validation process and consists of two steps: 1) the presentation of identity evidence by the identity proofing applicant to the CSP and 2) the determination by the CSP that the presented evidence meets the applicable strength requirements.</p>
<h3 id="evidence-strength" data-section="2">

</h3>

<p>This section defines the requirements for identity evidence at each strength. The strength of a piece of identity evidence is determined by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The level of rigor associated with its issuance process</li>
  <li>The ability to be validated to a given level of confidence, including accuracy and authenticity checks</li>
  <li>The ability to support one or more of the identity verification methods presented in <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63a.html#verification">Sec. 2.5.1</a></li>

  <li>There is a reasonable expectation that the issuing source of the evidence confirmed the claimed identity by following formal procedures designed to provide assurance that the claimed identity is associated with the subject, such as evidence issued by financial institutions that have customer identity verification obligations under the Customer Identification Program (CIP) rule or procedures for establishing a mobile phone account with a mobile network operator (MNO).</li>
  <li>The evidence has an issuance process that results in the delivery of the evidence to the person to whom it relates, such as delivery to a postal address, issuance in person, or through a protected remote provisioning process.</li>
  <li>The evidence contains the name of the claimed identity.</li>
  <li>The evidence contains at least one reference number, a facial image or other biometric characteristic, or sufficient attributes to uniquely identify the person to whom it relates.</li>
  <li>The evidence contains physical (e.g., security printing, optically variable features, holograms) or digital (e.g., digitally signed assertions, addressable SIM or ESIM) security features that make it difficult to reproduce.</li>
  <li>Core attributes on the evidence can be validated against information held by an authoritative or credible source, as described in <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63a.html#ValidSources">Sec. 2.4.2.4</a>.</li>

<p>In order to be considered SUPERIOR, identity evidence <strong class="normative">SHALL</strong> meet <em>all</em> of the following requirements:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The issuing source of the evidence confirmed the claimed identity by following written procedures (e.g., identity proofing at IAL2 or above) designed to enable it to have high confidence that the claimed identity is associated with the subject.

  <li>The identity evidence contains attributes and data objects that are cryptographically protected and can be validated using approved cryptography through verification of a digital signature applied by the issuing source.</li>
  <li>The issuing source had the subject participate in an attended enrollment and identity proofing process that confirmed their physical existence.</li>
  <li>The evidence has an issuance process that results in the delivery of the evidence to the person to whom it relates, such as delivery to a postal address, issuance in person, or through a protected remote provisioning process.</li>
  <li>The evidence contains the name of the claimed identity.</li>
  <li>The evidence contains at least one reference number that uniquely identifies the person to whom it relates.</li>
  <li>The evidence contains a facial image or other biometric characteristic of the person to whom it relates.</li>
  <li>The evidence contains physical (e.g., security printing, optically variable features, holograms) or digital security (e.g., digitally signed assertions, addressable SIM or ESIM) features that make it difficult to reproduce.</li>
  <li>The evidence can be validated through an approved method, as provided in <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/2_proofing.md#validation-methods">Sec. 2.4.2.2</a>.</li>

</h3>

<p>The goal of identity evidence validation is to determine that the collected identity evidence is genuine and valid. The goal of attribute validation is to confirm the accuracy of all the core attributes.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This document uses the term “valid” to recognize that evidence can remain a useful means to prove identity, even if it is expired or was issued outside of a determined time frame. CSPs define their policy for addressing expired evidence as part of the CSP practice statement described in <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63a.html#DocRecReqs">Sec. 3.1</a>, and RPs determine whether this is acceptable for accessing their online services.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Identity evidence validation involves examining the presented evidence to confirm that it is authentic (i.e., not forged or altered), accurate (i.e., the information on the evidence is correct), and valid (i.e., unexpired or within the CSP’s defined timeframe for issuance or expiration). Attribute validation involves confirming the accuracy of the core attributes, whether obtained from presented evidence or self-asserted. The following subsections provide acceptable methods for evidence and attribute validation.</p>

<p>The CSP <strong class="normative">SHALL</strong> validate the authenticity, accuracy, and validity of presented evidence by confirming that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The evidence is in the correct format and includes complete information for the identity evidence type</li>
  <li>The evidence does not show signs of being counterfeit or tampered with</li>
  <li>The evidence contains physical or digital security features</li>

</h4>

<p>Acceptable methods for validating presented evidence are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Visual and tactile inspection by trained personnel for on-site identity proofing</li>
  <li>Visual inspection by trained personnel for remote identity proofing</li>
  <li>Automated document validation processes using appropriate technologies</li>
  <li>Cryptographic verification of the source and integrity of digital evidence or attribute data objects</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>For some digital evidence (e.g., MNO/phone accounts), there is not a physical piece of evidence that can be validated visually or physically. Authenticity is confirmed by validating the identity attributes associated with that account and phone number with an issuing or credible source, such as by validating a digitally signed assertion from the issuer or querying an attribute validation service with access to that account information.</p>

<p>The CSP <strong class="normative">SHALL</strong> use authoritative or credible sources that meet the following criteria.</p>

<p>An authoritative source is the issuing source of identity evidence or attributes or has direct access to the information maintained by issuing sources. Examples of issuing sources include state departments of motor vehicles for driver’s license data and the Social Security Administration for Social Security cards and numbers. An example of an authoritative source that provides or enables direct access to issuing sources is the American Association of Motor Vehicle Administrators’ Driver’s License Data Verification (DLDV) Service.</p>

<p>A credible source has access to attribute information that can be traced to an authoritative source or maintains identity attribute information obtained from multiple sources that is correlated for accuracy, consistency, and currency. Credible sources are subject to regulatory oversight (e.g., the Fair Credit Reporting Act).</p>

</h3>

<p>The CSP <strong class="normative">SHALL</strong> verify the linkage between the claimed identity to the applicant engaged in the identity proofing process through one or more of the following methods.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Confirmation code veriﬁcation</strong>: The individual is able to demonstrate control of a piece of identity evidence through the return of a confirmation code, consistent with the requirements speciﬁed in <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/3_ialgen#ConfirmCodes">Sec. 3.8</a>.</li>
  <li><strong>Authentication and federation protocols</strong>: The individual is able to demonstrate control of a digital account (e.g., online bank account) or signed digital assertion through the use of authentication or federation protocols. This can be done in person, through presentation of the credential to a device or reader, or during a remote identity prooﬁng session.</li>
  <li><strong>Transaction verification</strong>: An individual is able to demonstrate control of a piece of evidence by returning a value based on a microtransaction made between the CSP and the issuing source of the evidence (e.g., a micro-deposit to verify ownership of a financial account).</li>
  <li><strong>Visual facial image comparison — on-site attended</strong>: The proofing agent and applicant interact directly during the identity prooﬁng process. The proofing agent performs a visual comparison of the facial image presented on identity evidence to the face of the applicant engaged in the identity prooﬁng event.</li>
  <li><strong>Visual facial image comparison — remote attended or remote unattended</strong>: The proofing agent performs a visual comparison of the facial image presented on identity evidence or stored by the issuing source to the facial image of the applicant engaged in the identity prooﬁng event. The proofing agent may interact directly with the applicant during some or all of the identity prooﬁng process or may conduct the comparison at a later time using a captured video or photograph and the uploaded copy of the evidence.</li>
  <li><strong>Automated biometric comparison</strong>: Automated biometric comparison (e.g., facial recognition or other fully automated algorithm-driven biometric comparison) can be performed for onsite or remote identity proofing events. The facial image or other biometric characteristic (e.g., fingerprints, palm prints, iris and retina patterns, voiceprints, vein patterns) on the identity evidence or stored in authoritative records is compared to the equivalent biometric sample collected from the applicant during the identity proofing event.</li>

</h2>

<p>A critical aspect of the identity proofing process is to mitigate fraudulent attempts to gain access to benefits, services, data, or assets that are protected by identity management systems. Resolution, validation, and verification processes are designed to mitigate many types of attacks. However, with the constantly changing threat environment, layering additional checks and controls can provide increased confidence in proofed identities and additional protections against advanced and emerging types of attacks. The ability to identify, detect, and resolve instances of potential fraud is a critical functionality for CSPs and RPs.</p>

  <li>CSPs <strong class="normative">SHALL</strong> implement a death records check for all identity proofing processes by confirming with a credible, authoritative, or issuing source that the applicant is not deceased. Such checks can aid in preventing synthetic identity fraud, the use of stolen identity information, and exploitation by a close associate or relative.</li>
  <li>CSPs <strong class="normative">SHOULD</strong> implement the following fraud checks for their identity proofing processes based on their available identity proofing types, selected technologies, evidence, and user base:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>SIM swap detection:</strong> Confirm that the phone number used in the identity proofing process has not been recently ported to a new user or device. Such checks can provide an indication that a phone or device was compromised by a targeted attack.</li>
      <li><strong>Device or account tenure check:</strong> Evaluate the length of time a phone service subscription or other account (e.g., email account) has existed without substantial modifications or changes. Such checks can provide additional confidence in the reliability of a device or piece of evidence used in the identity proofing process.</li>
      <li><strong>Mailing address check:</strong> Determine whether the mailing address is a known virtual Post Office (PO) Box or has other high-risk characteristics.</li>
      <li><strong>Device fingerprinting:</strong> Incorporate device fingerprinting checks to protect against scaled and automated attacks and enrollment duplication. Device fingerprinting is the process of collecting and analyzing the hardware and software characteristics of a device in order to create a unique identifier (i.e., fingerprint) for the device.</li>
      <li><strong>Transaction analytics:</strong> Evaluate anticipated transaction characteristics (e.g., IP addresses, geolocations, transaction velocities) to identify anomalous behaviors or activities that can indicate a higher risk or a potentially fraudulent event. Fraud velocity checks monitor the frequency and pattern of transactions over a specific period of time to identify unusual activity associated with transaction data. Such checks can protect against scaled and automated attacks, as well as indicate whether specific attack patterns are being executed on identity systems.</li>
      <li><strong>Fraud indicator check:</strong> Evaluate records (e.g., reported, confirmed, or historical fraud events) to determine whether there is an elevated risk related to a specific applicant, applicant’s data, or device. Such checks can indicate identity theft or compromise. Where such information is collected, aggregated, or exchanged across commercial platforms and made available for use by RPs and other CSPs, users <strong class="normative">SHALL</strong> be made aware of any privacy implications based on a privacy risk assessment.

</h2>

<p>This section includes requirements for CSPs that support the use of confirmation codes.</p>

<p>Confirmation codes are used to confirm that an applicant has access to a postal address, email address, or phone number for the purposes of future communications. Confirmation codes delivered to a postal or phone address can also be used as an identity verification option at IALs 1 and 2, as described in <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63a.html#ial1-verification">Sec. 4.1.6</a> and <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63a.html#ial2-verification">Sec. 4.2.6</a>.</p>

<p>Confirmation codes used for these purposes <strong class="normative">SHALL</strong> include at least 6 decimal digits (or equivalent) from an approved random bit generator (see <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63b.html#randomness" latex-href="#ref-SP800-63B">Sec. 3.2.12 of [SP800-63B]</a>). The confirmation code may be presented as numeric or printable ASCII representation for manual entry, a secure (e.g., https) link containing a representation of the confirmation code, or a machine-readable optical label (e.g., QR code) that contains the confirmation code.</p>

<p>Confirmation codes <strong class="normative">SHALL</strong> be valid for at most:</p>

<ul>
  <li>21 days when sent to a validated postal address within the contiguous United States</li>
  <li>30 days when sent to a validated postal address outside of the contiguous United States</li>
  <li>10 minutes when sent to a validated telephone number (SMS or voice)</li>
  <li>24 hours when sent to a validated email address</li>
</ul>

<p>Upon its use, the CSP <strong class="normative">SHALL</strong> invalidate the confirmation code.</p>
<h2 id="ContinueCodes" data-section="3">
  
  
    Requirements for Continuation Codes <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63a.html#ContinueCodes" class="header-link"><i class="fa fa-link"></i></a>
  
  
</h2>

<p>Continuation codes are used to reestablish an applicant’s linkage to an incomplete identity proofing or enrollment process. The continuation code provides a temporary secret that can connect one session to another. A typical scenario would involve an applicant starting an identity proofing process online (e.g., remote unattended) but needing to complete it through an in-person (e.g., on-site attended) event. This on-site service is often offered by a third party or through a channel that may not have the technology to support authentication of the applicant with established CSP-issued authenticators. If applicants are able to leverage established authenticators at all steps in the identity proofing process, then a continuation code is not needed.</p>

<p>As such, CSPs <strong class="normative">MAY</strong> use continuation codes when an applicant is unable to complete all of the steps necessary to be successfully identity-proofed and enrolled into the CSP’s identity service in a single session, particularly when switching between different identity proofing types. Continuation codes are intended to be maintained offline (e.g., printed or written down) and stored in a secure location by the applicant for use in reestablishing linkage to a previous, incomplete session. In order to facilitate the authentication of the applicant to a subsequent session with the CSP, the CSP <strong class="normative">SHOULD</strong> first bind an authenticator to a record or account that was established for the applicant prior to the cessation of the initial session.</p>

<p>If continuation codes are used, the following requirements apply:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Continuation codes <strong class="normative">SHOULD</strong> be delivered in-session but <strong class="normative">MAY</strong> be delivered out-of-band to a physical mailing address, phone number, or email address.</li>
  <li>Continuation codes <strong class="normative">SHALL</strong> include at least 64 bits from an approved random bit generator (see <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63b.html#randomness" latex-href="#ref-SP800-63B">Sec. 3.2.12 of [SP800-63B]</a>).</li>
  <li>The continuation code <strong class="normative">MAY</strong> be presented as numeric or printable ASCII representation for manual entry or as a machine-readable optical label (e.g., QR code).</li>
  <li>The verification of continuation codes <strong class="normative">SHALL</strong> be subject to throttling requirements, as provided in <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63b.html#throttle" latex-href="#ref-SP800-63B">Sec. 3.2.2 of [SP800-63B]</a>.</li>
  <li>Continuation codes <strong class="normative">SHALL</strong> be stored in hashed form using a Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS)-approved or NIST-recommended one-way function.</li>
  <li>Upon its use, the CSP <strong class="normative">SHALL</strong> invalidate the continuation code.</li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
  <p>Since substantial time may elapse between when an applicant receives their continuation code and when they are able to complete the proofing process, expiry is not defined in these guidelines. This will need to be defined by the CSP based on their processes, technologies, and partnerships.</p>

</h2>

<p>Notifications of proofing are sent to the applicant’s validated address to inform them that they have been successfully identity-proofed and provide them with information about the identity proofing event and subsequent enrollment. Additionally, the notification explains how the recipient can dispute their involvement in the identity proofing events.</p>

<p>The following requirements apply to notifications of proofing at any IAL:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong class="normative">SHALL</strong> be sent to a validated postal address or phone number at all IALs or <strong class="normative">MAY</strong> be sent to a validated email address at IAL1</li>
  <li><strong class="normative">SHALL</strong> include details about the identity proofing event, including the name of the identity service and the date on which the identity proofing was completed</li>
  <li><strong class="normative">SHALL</strong> provide clear instructions, including contact information, on actions for the recipient to take if they repudiate their participation in the identity proofing event</li>
  <li><strong class="normative">SHALL</strong> provide information about how the organization or CSP protects the security and confidentiality of the information it collects</li>
  <li><strong class="normative">SHALL</strong> provide information about any responsibilities that the recipient has as a subscriber of the identity service</li>
  <li><strong class="normative">SHOULD</strong> provide instructions on how to access their subscriber account or information about how the subscriber can update the information contained in that account</li>
</ol>

<p>If a subscriber repudiates having been identity-proofed by the identity service, the CSP or RP <strong class="normative">SHALL</strong> respond in accordance with its established fraud management and redress policies.</p>
<h2 id="ProofBios" data-section="3">
  
  
    Requirements for the Use of Biometrics <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63a.html#ProofBios" class="header-link"><i class="fa fa-link"></i></a>
  
  
</h2>

<p>Biometrics refers to the automated recognition of individuals based on their biological and behavioral characteristics, such as facial features, fingerprints, voice patterns, keystroke patterns, angle of holding a smart phone, screen pressure, typing speed, mouse movements, or gait.  As used in these guidelines, biometric data refers to any analog or digital representation of biological and behavioral characteristics at any stage of their capture, storage, or processing, including the transmission of biometric data to other applications or service partners. This includes live biometric samples from applicants (e.g., facial images, fingerprint) as well as biometric references obtained from evidence (e.g., facial image on a driver’s license, fingerprint minutiae template on identification cards). As applied to the identity proofing process, CSPs can use biometrics to verify that an individual is the rightful subject of identity evidence, to bind an individual to a new piece of identity evidence or credential, or for the purposes of deduplication. These requirements also address the additional privacy impacts associated with the use of biometrics in the identity proofing process.</p>

<p>The following requirements apply to CSPs that employ biometrics as part of their identity proofing process:</p>

<ol>
  <li>CSPs <strong class="normative">SHALL</strong> provide clear, publicly available information about all uses of biometrics, including what biometric data is collected, how it is stored and protected, and how to remove biometric data consistent with applicable laws and regulations.</li>
  <li>CSPs <strong class="normative">SHALL</strong> obtain explicit informed consent to collect and use biometrics from all applicants.</li>
  <li>CSPs <strong class="normative">SHALL</strong> store a record of the subscriber’s consent for biometric use and associate it with the subscriber’s account.</li>
  <li>CSPs <strong class="normative">SHALL</strong> have a documented and publicly available deletion process and default retention period for all biometric information. Retention periods <strong class="normative">SHALL</strong> be consistent with applicable regulations, policies, and statutes for the regions and sectors that the CSP serves.</li>
  <li>CSPs <strong class="normative">SHOULD</strong> support the deletion of all of a subscriber’s biometric information upon the subscriber’s request, except where otherwise restricted by regulation, law, or policy. CSPs that do not support biometric deletion requests <strong class="normative">SHALL</strong> publicly document the regulatory, statutory, or risk-based justification for their policy.</li>
  <li>CSPs <strong class="normative">SHALL</strong> have their biometric recognition and attack detection algorithms periodically tested by independent entities (e.g., accredited laboratories or research institutions) for their performance characteristics, including performance across demographic groups. In addition, the CSP <strong class="normative">SHOULD</strong> conduct internal testing on biometric algorithms based on the update schedule of the provider.</li>
  <li>CSPs <strong class="normative">SHALL</strong> assess the performance and demographic impacts of employed biometric technologies in conditions that are substantially similar to the operational environment and user base of the system. The user base is defined by both the expected users and the devices they are expected to use. When such assessments include real-world users, participation by users <strong class="normative">SHALL</strong> be voluntary.</li>
  <li>CSPs <strong class="normative">SHALL</strong> meet the following performance thresholds if one-to-one (1:1) comparison algorithms are used for verification against a claimed identity:
    <ul>
      <li>False match rate: 1:10,000 or better</li>
      <li>False non-match rate: 1:100 or better</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>CSPs <strong class="normative">MAY</strong> use one-to-many (1:N) identification in support of resolution or deduplication, pursuant to a privacy risk assessment. In 1:N scenarios, CSPs <strong class="normative">SHALL</strong> meet a minimum performance threshold for false positive identification of 1:1,000 or better.</li>
  <li>A 1:N search of an applicant’s collected biometric characteristics against a database is done to determine whether the applicant is already present in the database, possibly under a different name. The false positive identification rate (FPIR) refers to the proportion of 1:N searches in which a biometric system incorrectly identifies another person as a match, which is a false positive result. The performance metric of 1:1,000 means that a false positive outcome occurs for no more than 1 in every 1,000 searches. Tests that demonstrate this requirement <strong class="normative">SHALL</strong> employ a gallery no smaller than 90 % of the current or intended operational size (N).</li>
  <li>CSPs that make use of 1:N biometric identification for resolution, deduplication, or fraud detection purposes <strong class="normative">SHALL NOT</strong> decline a user’s enrollment without a manual review to confirm the automated search results and confirm that the results are not a false positive identification (e.g., twins submitting face photographs for different accounts with the same CSP).</li>
  <li>Biometric verification technologies <strong class="normative">SHALL</strong> provide performance for applicants of different demographic types that is no more than 25 % worse than the performance for the overall population. For example, if the measured false non-match rate (FNMR) for the overall population is 0.006, the FNMR for a specific demographic group cannot exceed 0.0075. Similarly, if the false match rate (FMR) for the overall population is 0.0001, the FMR for each demographic group cannot exceed 0.000125. The biometric system <strong class="normative">SHALL</strong> be configured with a fixed threshold; it is not feasible to change the threshold for each demographic group. Demographic categories to be considered <strong class="normative">SHALL</strong> include sex, age, and skin tone when these factors affect biometric performance.</li>
  <li>All biometric performance tests <strong class="normative">SHALL</strong> be conformant to ISO/IEC 19795-1:2021 and ISO/IEC 19795-10:2024, including demographics testing.</li>
  <li>CSPs <strong class="normative">SHALL</strong> make the results of their biometric algorithm performance and biometric system operational test results publicly available. The CSP <strong class="normative">MAY</strong> provide these test results in summary form if the results indicate performance against the defined metrics in these guidelines and across the tested demographic groups.</li>

  <li>CSP <strong class="normative">SHALL</strong> collect biometric characteristics in a way that provides reasonable assurance that the biometric characteristic is collected from the applicant and not another subject.</li>
  <li>When collecting and comparing biometric characteristics remotely, the CSP <strong class="normative">SHALL</strong> implement presentation attack detection (PAD) capabilities that meet the impostor attack presentation accept rate (IAPAR) performance metric of &lt;0.07 to confirm the genuine presence of a live human being and to mitigate spoofing and impersonation attempts.

</h2>

<p>Proofing agents and trusted referees that support identity verification will need to be able to compare the facial portraits on presented evidence to the applicant claiming the identity represented in that evidence.

  <li>Proofing agents and trusted referees <strong class="normative">SHALL</strong> be assessed on their ability to conduct visual facial image comparisons. Additionally, proofing agents and trusted referees <strong class="normative">SHALL</strong> be reassessed on an annual basis and remedially trained, if needed. Training <strong class="normative">SHALL</strong> be designed to reflect potential real-world attack scenarios, such as comparing applicants to images of relatives, twins, and individuals with a similar appearance.</li>
  <li>CSPs <strong class="normative">SHALL</strong> provide proofing agents and trusted referees that conduct visual facial comparisons during remote attended transactions with resources that support accurate comparisons, such as high-quality image feeds, high-definition monitors, and image analysis software.</li>
  <li>CSPs <strong class="normative">SHALL</strong> document their training and assessment procedures for visual image comparisons and make them available to RPs upon request.</li>

</h2>

<p>The validation of physical evidence can be conducted by optical capture and inspection (often called document authentication or “doc auth”) or via visual inspection by a trained proofing agent or trusted referee. CSPs can employ either or both processes to evaluate the authenticity of identity evidence.</p>

<p>The following requirements apply to CSPs that employ optical capture and inspection for the purposes of determining document authenticity:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Automated evidence validation technology <strong class="normative">SHALL</strong> meet the following performance measures:
    <ul>
      <li>Document false acceptance rate (DFAR) of 0.1 or less<sup id="fnref:Note_DFAR" role="doc-noteref"><a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63a.html#fn:Note_DFAR" class="footnote">6</a></sup></li>
      <li>Document false rejection rate (DFRR) of 0.1 or less<sup id="fnref:Note_DFRR" role="doc-noteref"><a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63a.html#fn:Note_DFRR" class="footnote">7</a></sup></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>If a Machine Readable Zone (MRZ) or barcode is present on the evidence, the optical capture and inspection <strong class="normative">SHALL</strong> compare the MRZ data to the printed data on the evidence for consistency.</li>
  <li>CSPs <strong class="normative">SHALL</strong> implement live capture of documents during the validation process and <strong class="normative">SHALL</strong> implement passive or active document presence checks (also called document liveness). Live capture techniques confirm that the document is physically present and that the image captured during the identity proofing session is not a manipulated digital copy. For additional requirements to prevent the injection of modified media (i.e., digitally generated video or images of evidence), see <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63a.html#DigInject">Sec. 3.14</a>.</li>
  <li>CSPs <strong class="normative">SHALL</strong> assess the performance of employed optical capture and inspection technologies in conditions that are substantially similar to the operational environment and the types of evidence presented by the user base of the system. These tests <strong class="normative">SHALL</strong> account for all available identity evidence types that the CSPs allow to be validated using optical capture and inspection technology. If subscribers’ documents, personal information, or images are used as part of the testing, it <strong class="normative">SHALL</strong> be on a voluntary basis and with subscriber notification and consent.</li>
  <li>CSPs <strong class="normative">SHOULD</strong> have their evidence validation technology periodically tested by independent entities (e.g., accredited laboratories or research institutions) for their performance characteristics.</li>
  <li>CSPs <strong class="normative">SHALL</strong> make the results of their testing publicly available.</li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
  <p>These requirements apply to technologies that capture and validate images of physical identity evidence. They do not apply to validation techniques that rely on PKI or other cryptographic technologies that are embedded in the evidence themselves.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The following requirements apply to CSPs that employ visual inspection of evidence by trained proofing agents or trusted referees for the purposes of determining document authenticity:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Proofing agents and trusted referees <strong class="normative">SHALL</strong> be trained and provided with the resources to visually inspect all forms of evidence supported by the CSP. This training <strong class="normative">SHALL</strong> include:
    <ul>
      <li>Authentic layouts and topography of evidence types</li>
      <li>Physical security features (e.g., raised letters, holographic features, microprinting)</li>
      <li>Techniques for assessing features (e.g., tools to be used, where tactile inspection is needed, manipulation required to view specific features)</li>
      <li>Common indications of tampering (e.g., damage to the lamination, image modification)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Proofing agents and trusted referees <strong class="normative">SHALL</strong> be assessed regarding their ability to visually inspect evidence based on their training. Additionally, proofing agents and trusted referees <strong class="normative">SHALL</strong> be reassessed on an annual basis or whenever significant new threats to the evidence validation process are identified and remedially trained as needed.</li>
  <li>Proofing agents and trusted referees <strong class="normative">SHALL</strong> be provided with specialized tools and equipment to support the visual inspection of evidence (e.g., magnifiers, ultraviolet lights, barcode readers) as appropriate for the identity evidence type.</li>
  <li>Proofing agents and trusted referees who conduct visual inspections via remote means <strong class="normative">SHALL</strong> be provided with devices and internet connections that support sufficiently high-quality imagery to be able to effectively inspect presented evidence. In these instances, the visual validation <strong class="normative">SHOULD</strong> be supported by automated document validation technologies that provide additional confidence in the authenticity of the evidence (e.g., submitting and validating evidence in advance of an attended remote session).</li>
  <li>CSPs <strong class="normative">SHALL</strong> document their training and assessment procedures for visual inspections of evidence and make them available to RPs upon request.</li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
  <p>Due to the potential number and permutations of identity evidence, these guidelines do not attempt to provide a comprehensive list of security features. CSPs need to provide evidence validation training that is specific to the types of identity evidence they accept.</p>

    Digital Injection Prevention and Forged Media Detection <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63a.html#DigInject" class="header-link"><i class="fa fa-link"></i></a>
  
  
</h2>

<p>Many emerging attacks on both attended and unattended remote identity proofing processes pair digital injection attacks with increasingly effective and available generative AI tools. These AI tools are used to create or modify media that contain images or videos of applicants and evidence (i.e., deepfakes) to defeat automated document validation processes, biometric operations, and visual comparisons done by proofing agents. Injection attacks insert modified or forged media between the capture point (e.g., a device) and the element conducting the comparison or other operation (e.g., a server running the algorithms, a workstation used by a proofing agent).</p>

<p>All types of remote identity proofing are in some way vulnerable to these forms of attack, whether the attack is on the remote optical capture and inspection components, the automated biometric mechanisms, or the video systems used in remote attended processes.</p>

<p>A biometric comparison performed with a captured sample does not prevent these attacks. However, live document capture and presentation attack detection mechanisms do provide some protection from injection and forged media attacks by making the injection of viable forged media more challenging. Not only does the media need to be inserted into the communication channel between the applicant endpoint and the CSP comparison component, but the forged media would also need to sufficiently defeat any passive or active presentation attack detection mechanisms implemented by the CSP.  However, even these mechanisms are not sufficient to address all possible cases of these kinds of attacks.</p>

<p>The following requirements apply to all remote identity proofing processes (i.e., unattended and attended) that make use of optical capture and recognition tools for evidence validation, remote biometric capture, and video sessions:</p>

<ol>
  <li>CSPs <strong class="normative">SHALL</strong> implement technical controls to increase confidence that digital media is being produced by a genuine sensor during the proofing process (e.g., detect the presence of a virtual camera, device emulator, or a jailbroken device).</li>
  <li>CSPs <strong class="normative">SHALL</strong> analyze all digital media submitted during the identity proofing process for artifacts and indicators of potential modification, manipulation, tampering, or forgery. Automated image analysis algorithms <strong class="normative">SHALL</strong> be tested against available attack artifacts (i.e., forged and manipulated images and videos) and genuine media to provide a baseline of performance and to determine the expected rate of false positives and false negatives generated by the system. The kinds of available attack artifacts that were tested and the corresponding false negative rates <strong class="normative">SHALL</strong> be documented and made available to RPs upon request. Algorithmic analysis of media and automated decisioning <strong class="normative">SHOULD</strong> be augmented by manual reviews to address detection errors.</li>
  <li>CSPs <strong class="normative">SHALL</strong> only use authenticated protected channels for the exchange of data during remote identity proofing processes.</li>
  <li>CSPs <strong class="normative">SHOULD</strong> introduce a passive means of detecting forged or manipulated media for all capture scenarios.</li>
  <li>CSPs <strong class="normative">SHOULD</strong> authenticate capture sensors or implement device attestation to increase the confidence in a device being used to transmit digital media as part of a remote identity proofing process.</li>
  <li>CSPs <strong class="normative">SHOULD</strong> analyze digital media for signatures of generative AI algorithms and deepfake tools that are known to be used to create forged digital media.</li>
</ol>

<p>The following additional requirements apply to remote attended collection scenarios:</p>

<ol>
  <li>CSPs <strong class="normative">SHALL</strong> train proofing agents and trusted referees to look for indications of manipulated media (e.g., high latency, synchronization issues, inconsistent skin tone and resolution).</li>
  <li>CSPs <strong class="normative">SHALL</strong> introduce random “human-in-the-loop” cues into their capture processes to increase the possibility of forged or manipulated media being detected (e.g., by requesting user movements or requesting that the user move objects between the capture sensor and their face).</li>

    Exception and Error Handling <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63a.html#TRs-ARs" class="header-link"><i class="fa fa-link"></i></a>
  
  
</h2>

<p>Throughout the identity proofing process, there are many points at which errors or failures may occur. Such exceptions to a standard identity proofing workflow include process failures (e.g., when a user does not possess the required evidence), technical failures (e.g., when an integrated service is not available), and failures due to user error (e.g., when an applicant is unable to capture a clear image of their identity evidence using remote validation tools).</p>

<p>In order to increase the accessibility of their identity proofing services and address customer experience challenges, CSPs <strong class="normative">SHALL</strong> document their operational processes for dealing with errors and handling exceptions.  These documented processes <strong class="normative">SHOULD</strong> include providing trusted referees to support applicants who are otherwise unable to meet the requirements of IALs 1 and 2. Additionally, CSPs <strong class="normative">SHOULD</strong> support the use of applicant references who can vouch for an applicant’s attributes, conditions, or identity.</p>

<p>Trusted referees are used to increase access to online services by facilitating the identity proofing and enrollment of individuals who are otherwise unable to prove their identities using the usual identity proofing process for a specific IAL. A non-exhaustive list of examples of individuals who may need the assistance of trusted referees includes those who do not possess and cannot obtain the required identity evidence, persons with disabilities, older individuals, persons experiencing homelessness, individuals with limited access to online services or computing devices, persons without a bank account or with limited credit history, victims of identity theft, individuals displaced or affected by natural disasters, and children under 18. Trusted referees can be provided by the CSP, a third party, or an RP. The following requirements apply whenever trusted referees are used:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The CSP <strong class="normative">SHALL</strong> notify the public of the availability of trusted referee services and how such services are obtained.</li>
  <li>The CSP <strong class="normative">SHALL</strong> establish written policies and procedures for the use of trusted referees as part of its practice statement, as specified in <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63a.html#DocRecReqs">Sec. 3.1</a>.</li>
  <li>The CSP <strong class="normative">SHALL</strong> train and certify its trusted referees to make risk-based decisions that allow applicants to be successfully identity-proofed based on their unique circumstances. At a minimum, such training <strong class="normative">SHALL</strong> include:
    <ol>
      <li>Document identification and validation, such as common templates, security features, layouts, and topography (see <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63a.html#authenticity-checks">Sec. 3.13</a>)</li>
      <li>Indicators of fraudulent documents, such as damage, tampering, modification, fabrication, or forgery (see <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63a.html#authenticity-checks">Sec. 3.13</a>)</li>

      <li>Indicators of social engineering exhibited by an applicant, such as distress, confusion, or coercion</li>
      <li>An annual review of the trusted referee’s abilities to visually inspect evidence and make visual facial image comparisons (see <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63a.html#facial-image-comparison">Sec. 3.12</a>)</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>The CSP <strong class="normative">SHALL</strong> establish a record of any identity proofing session that involves a trusted referee, including the reasons why a trusted referee was used (e.g., automated process failure, applicant request, established exception policy), the identity of the trusted referee, what evidence was presented, which processes were completed (e.g., validation or verification), and the trusted referee’s decision and, if negative, their rationale.</li>
  <li>The CSP <strong class="normative">MAY</strong> offer trusted referee services for either on-site attended or remote attended sessions.

</h3>

<p>Trusted referees offer a critical path for those who are unable to complete identity proofing by other means. However, given the number of possible failures that may occur within the proofing process, it is essential for CSPs to define the uses for which a trusted referee can be applied within their own service offerings. The following requirements apply to defining the integration of trusted referees into the identity proofing process:</p>

<ol>
  <li>CSPs <strong class="normative">SHALL</strong> document which types of exceptions and failures are eligible for the use of a trusted referee.</li>
  <li>CSPs <strong class="normative">SHOULD</strong> offer trusted referee services for failures of automated verification processes (e.g., biometric comparisons).</li>
  <li>CSPs <strong class="normative">SHOULD</strong> offer trusted referee services for failures in completing automated validation processes, such as mismatched core attributes or the absence of the applicant in a record source. If a CSP offers trusted referees for this purpose, the following requirements apply:
    <ol>
      <li>CSPs <strong class="normative">SHALL</strong> provide a policy for additional evidence types that may be used to corroborate core attributes or changes in core attributes.</li>
      <li>Trusted referees <strong class="normative">SHALL</strong> review additional evidence types for authenticity to the greatest degree allowed by the evidence.</li>
      <li>If no authoritative or credible records are available to support validation, the trusted referee <strong class="normative">MAY</strong> compare the attributes on additional pieces of evidence with the strongest piece of evidence available to corroborate the consistency of core attributes.</li>
      <li>If there is a partial mismatch of core attributes to authoritative records, the trusted referee <strong class="normative">SHALL</strong> review evidence that supports the legitimacy of the asserted attribute value (e.g., recent move or change of name).</li>

<p>Applicant references are individuals who participate in the identity proofing of an applicant in order to vouch for the applicant’s identity, attributes, or circumstances related to the applicant’s ability to complete identity proofing. Applicant references are not agents of the CSP, but rather representatives of the applicant who have sufficient knowledge to aid in the completion of identity proofing when other forms of evidence, validation, and verification are not available.</p>

<p>Applicant references can take several different actions to support an applicant in the identity proofing process, depending on the circumstances and context of the CSP and RP services. CSPs <strong class="normative">SHOULD</strong> offer the use of applicant references if the risks to the online service of doing so allow for it.

<blockquote>
  <p>Delivering a confirmation code to a physical address combined with the requirement to validate the address with an authoritative source provides reasonable deterrence against scaled, high-volume attacks on identity proofing processes and substantially impacts the time-to-value for attackers. For this reason, mailed confirmation codes are a viable option for identity proofing at IAL2 when biometrics or visual comparisons fail or alternative means are required (e.g., due to a subscriber’s limited access to technology or services). Such delivery methods remain vulnerable to interception by close associates and family members and to other schemes (e.g., mail-forwarding fraud). Organizations that assess a high likelihood and impact of such attacks should offer other methods of verification or apply additional mitigating controls.</p>

<p>Some CSPs need to support a single user’s ability to interact with the CSP while fulfilling different roles or personas. For example, a subscriber may interact as themselves and also as a representative of a business across different services supported by the CSP.  Another scenario is a CSP that serves both commercial and federal RPs and must maintain a separation between its services. To limit fraud and avoid redundant costs and processes, CSPs <strong class="normative">SHOULD</strong> provide users with a means to manage multiple user personas without having to create multiple subscriber accounts. If this is not possible, and multiple subscriber accounts are supported for a single subscriber, the CSP <strong class="normative">SHOULD</strong> implement its subscriber accounts in a manner that avoids unnecessary re-proofing of the same subscriber (e.g., linking accounts via a common identifier or through biometric or attribute resolution).</p>

<p>If multiple subscriber accounts are permitted for a single subscriber, the following requirements apply:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The CSP <strong class="normative">SHALL</strong> develop and document their process for reviewing and assessing subscribers with multiple accounts to identify possible fraud.</li>
  <li>The CSP <strong class="normative">SHALL</strong> maintain a mapping of all accounts associated with a unique government identifier or common core attributes.</li>

<p><em>This section is informative.</em></p>

<p>Effectively protecting identity proofing processes requires layering security controls and processes throughout a transaction with a given applicant. To achieve this, it is necessary to understand where and how threats can arise and compromise enrollments. There are four general categories of threats to the identity proofing process:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Impersonation</strong>: An attacker attempts to pose as another legitimate individual (e.g., identity theft)</li>
  <li><strong>False or fraudulent representation</strong>: An attacker attempts to create a false identity or false claims about an identity (e.g., synthetic identity fraud)</li>
  <li><strong>Social engineering attacks</strong>: An attacker uses deception or coercion to convince a victim to take some action during the identity proofing process with the ultimate goal of controlling access to the resulting subscriber account</li>
  <li><strong>Infrastructure attacks</strong>: An attacker attempts to compromise the confidentiality, availability, or integrity of the infrastructure, data, software, or people supporting the CSP’s identity proofing process (e.g., distributed denial of service, insider threats)</li>
</ol>

<p>This section focuses on impersonation attacks, false or fraudulent representation threats, and social engineering attacks. Infrastructure threats are addressed by traditional computer security controls (e.g., intrusion protection, record keeping, independent audits) and are outside of the scope of this document. For additional security controls beyond what are provided in these guidelines, see <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63a.html#ref-SP800-53">[SP800-53]</a>, <em>Recommended Security and Privacy Controls for Federal Information Systems and Organizations</em>.</p>

  <p>This section does not provide guidance or controls that specifically address AI as a discrete threat type. Instead, the mitigations below and the requirements in these guidelines address specific threats that may be perpetrated or scaled by attackers with AI tools (e.g., using AI-generated forged documents or media to impersonate an applicant).</p>

<p>A close coordination of identity proofing and CSP functions with cybersecurity, privacy, threat intelligence, and program integrity teams can enable a more complete protection of business capabilities while constantly improving identity proofing capabilities. For example, payment fraud data collected by program integrity teams could indicate compromised subscriber accounts and potential weaknesses in identity proofing implementations. Similarly, threat intelligence teams may receive indications of new tactics, techniques, and procedures that may impact identity proofing processes. CSPs and RPs should seek to establish consistent mechanisms for exchanging information between critical security and fraud stakeholders. If the CSP is external to the RP, contractual and legal mechanisms can be used to establish these mechanisms, including technical and interoperability considerations. All data collected, transmitted, or shared should be minimized and subject to a detailed privacy and legal assessment.</p>

<p>These guidelines permit the collection and processing of only the personal information necessary to validate the claimed identity, associate the claimed identity to the applicant, mitigate fraud, and provide RPs with the attributes they may use to make authorization decisions. Processing personal information, including biometric data, that is unnecessary for the identify proofing service can cause individuals to be concerned that their data is being used in ways that exceed their expectations or authorization. This could lead to privacy problems, such as embarrassment, loss of autonomy, or loss of trust. Furthermore, the retention of personal information can become vulnerable to unauthorized access or use. Data minimization reduces the amount of personal information that is vulnerable to unauthorized access or use and encourages trust in the identity proofing process.</p>

<p>These guidelines permit the CSP to collect SSNs as an attribute for use in identity resolution. However, overreliance on the SSN can contribute to misuse and place the applicant at risk of harm, such as through identity theft. Nonetheless, the SSN may facilitate identity resolution for CSPs, particularly federal agencies that use the SSN to correlate an applicant to agency records. This document recognizes the role of the SSN as an attribute and makes appropriate allowances for its use. Knowledge of the SSN is not sufficient to serve as identity evidence.</p>

<p>Where possible, CSPs and agencies should consider mechanisms to limit the proliferation and exposure of SSNs during the identity proofing process. This is particularly pertinent if the SSN is communicated to third-party providers during attribute validation processes. To the extent possible, privacy protection techniques and technologies should be applied to reduce the risk of an individual’s SSN being exposed, stored, or maintained by third-party systems. Examples of this could be the use of attribute claims (e.g., yes/no responses from a validator) to confirm the validity of an SSN without requiring it to be unnecessarily transmitted by the third party. As with all attributes in the identity proofing process, the value and risk of each attribute being processed is subject to a privacy risk assessment, and federal agencies may address it in their associated PIA and SORN documentation. A CSP is permitted to collect an applicant’s SSN if the CSP considers it to be a core attribute or to support identity resolution.</p>

</h2>

<p>These guidelines require the CSP to provide explicit notice to the applicant at the time of collection regarding the purpose for collecting and maintaining a record of the attributes necessary for identity proofing, including whether such attributes are voluntary or mandatory and the consequences for not providing the attributes. Additionally, <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63a.html#ProofBios">Sec. 3.1.11</a> requires CSPs that collect or process biometric data to provide detailed, publicly available information about this process. An effective notice considers user experience, design standards, research, and an assessment of privacy risks that may arise from the collection. Various factors should be considered, including incorrectly inferring that applicants understand why attributes are collected and that collected information may be combined with other data sources. An effective notice is never only a pointer leading to a complex, legalistic privacy policy or general terms and conditions that applicants are unlikely to read or understand.</p>

<p>Consent allows individuals to participate in making decisions about the processing of their information and transfers some of the risk that arises from the processing of personally identifiable information from the organization to an individual. At a minimum, these guidelines require CSPs to obtain consent from users prior to collecting and using biometric data and prior to recording an identity proofing session, as provided in <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63a.html#ProofBios">Sec. 3.1.11</a>. RPs should provide additional guidance to applicants on available choices for the selection of CSPs, identity document requirements, related privacy notices, and alternative means of accessing services.</p>

<p>These guidelines require CSPs to employ measures that maintain predictability (i.e., enabling reliable assumptions by individuals, owners, and operators about the processing of personal information by an information system) and manageability (i.e., providing the capability for the granular administration of personal information, including alteration, deletion, and selective disclosure of personal information) commensurate with the privacy risks that can arise from processing attributes for purposes other than identity proofing, authentication, authorization, attribute assertion, related fraud mitigation, or to comply with laws or legal processes. The NIST Privacy Framework <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63a.html#ref-NIST-Privacy">[NIST-Privacy]</a> provides a framework for managing these risks and supporting privacy risk management principles.</p>

<p>CSPs may have various business purposes for processing attributes, including providing non-identity services to subscribers. However, processing attributes for other purposes than those disclosed to a subject can create additional privacy risks. CSPs can determine appropriate measures commensurate with the privacy risks that arise from additional processing. For example, absent applicable laws, regulations, or policies, it may not be necessary to obtain consent when processing attributes to provide non-identity services requested by subscribers, although notices may help subscribers maintain reliable assumptions about the processing (i.e., predictability). Other processing of attributes may carry different privacy risks that may call for obtaining consent or giving subscribers more control over the use or disclosure of specific attributes (i.e., manageability). CSPs cannot make the acceptance of these consent measures a condition of using the identity service.</p>

<p>Federal agencies should consult their SAOP if there are questions about whether the proposed processing falls outside of the scope of the permitted processing or the appropriate privacy risk mitigation measures.</p>

</h2>

<p>These guidelines require the CSP to provide effective and secure mechanisms for redressing applicant complaints or problems that arise from identity proofing and make the mechanisms easy for applicants to find and access.</p>

<p>The Privacy Act requires federal CSPs that maintain a system of records to follow procedures to enable applicants to access and amend their records. Any Privacy Act Statement should include references to applicable SORNs (see <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63a.html#PrivacyReqs">Sec. 3.3</a>), which provide the applicant with instructions on how to make a request for access or correction. Non-federal CSPs should have comparable procedures, including contact information for any third parties that are the sources of information.</p>

<p>If an applicant is unable to establish their identity and complete the online enrollment process, CSPs should make the availability of alternative methods for completing the process clear to applicants (e.g., in person at a customer service center).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If the identity proofing process is not successful, CSPs should inform the applicant of the procedures to address the issue but should not inform the applicant of the specifics of why the registration failed (e.g., do not inform the applicant, “Your SSN did not match the one that we have on record for you”), as doing so could allow fraudulent applicants to gain more knowledge about the accuracy of the personal information.</p>
</blockquote>

</h2>

<p>These guidelines require the CSP to conduct a privacy risk assessment. In conducting a privacy risk assessment, CSPs should consider:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The likelihood that an action it takes (e.g., additional verification steps or records retention) could create a privacy problem for the applicant, such as loss of trust</li>
  <li>The impact on the applicant if a problem should occur. CSPs should be able to justify any response they take to identified privacy risks, including accepting the risk, mitigating the risk, and sharing the risk. Applicant consent is considered to be a form of sharing the risk and, therefore, should only be used when an applicant could reasonably be expected to have the capacity to assess and accept this shared risk.</li>

    Agency-Specific Privacy Compliance <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63a.html#agency-specific-privacy-compliance" class="header-link"><i class="fa fa-link"></i></a>
  
  
</h2>

<p>These guidelines cover specific compliance obligations for federal CSPs. It is critical to involve an agency’s SAOP in the earliest stages of identity service development to assess and mitigate privacy risks and advise the agency on compliance requirements, such as whether the collection of personal information to conduct identity proofing triggers the Privacy Act of 1974 <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63a.html#ref-PrivacyAct">[PrivacyAct]</a> or the E-Government Act of 2002 <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63a.html#ref-E-Gov">[E-Gov]</a> requirement to conduct a PIA. For example, with respect to identity proofing, it is likely that Privacy Act requirements will be triggered and require coverage by either a new or existing Privacy Act SORN due to the collection and maintenance of personal information or other attributes that are necessary to conduct identity proofing.</p>

<p>The SAOP can similarly assist the agency in determining whether a PIA is required. These considerations should not be read as a requirement to develop a Privacy Act SORN or PIA for identity proofing alone. In many cases, it will make the most sense to draft a PIA and SORN that encompass the entire digital identity life cycle or include the identity proofing process as part of a larger, programmatic PIA that discusses the program or benefit to which the agency is establishing online access.</p>

<p>Due to the many components of the digital identity life cycle, it is important for the SAOP to be aware and understand each individual component. For example, other privacy artifacts may be applicable to an agency that offers or uses identity proofing services (e.g., data use agreements, computer matching agreements). The SAOP can assist the agency in determining what additional requirements apply. Moreover, a thorough understanding of the individual components of identity proofing will enable the SAOP to thoroughly assess and mitigate privacy risks either through compliance or other means.</p>

</h1>

<p><em>This section is informative.</em></p>

<p>To align with the standard terminology of user-centered design, customer experience, and usability, the term “user” is used throughout this section to refer to the human party. In most cases, the user in question will be the subject in the role of applicant, claimant, or subscriber, as described elsewhere in these guidelines. Customer experience sits at the nexus of usability, accessibility, and optionality. Considering user needs allows organizations to provide responsive and secure identity solutions while minimizing unnecessary friction and frustration.</p>

<p>This section is intended to raise implementers’ awareness of customer experience considerations associated with identity proofing and enrollment.</p>

</h2>

<p><a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63a.html#ref-ISOIEC9241">[ISO/IEC9241-11]</a> focuses on the users, goals, and context of use as the necessary elements for achieving effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction. A holistic approach that considers these key elements is necessary to achieve usability.</p>

<p>The overarching goal of usability for identity proofing and enrollment is to promote a smooth, positive enrollment process for users by minimizing user burden (e.g., time, frustration) and enrollment friction (e.g., the number of steps to complete, the amount of information to track). To achieve this goal, organizations must first familiarize themselves with their users.</p>

<p>The identity proofing and enrollment process establishes a user’s interactions with a given CSP and the online services that the user will access. As negative first impressions can influence user perception of subsequent interactions, organizations need to promote a positive user experience throughout the process.</p>

<p>An effective usability evaluation on the identity proofing and enrollment process involves representative users, realistic goals and tasks, and appropriate contexts of use. The identity proofing and enrollment process should be designed and implemented so that it is easy for users to do the right thing, hard for them to do the wrong thing, and easy for them to recover if the wrong thing happens. <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63a.html#ref-ISOIEC9241">[ISO/IEC9241-11]</a>, <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63a.html#ref-ISO16982">[ISO16982]</a>, and <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63a.html#ref-ISO25060">[ISO25060]</a> provide guidance on how to evaluate the overall usability of an identity service and additional considerations for improving usability.</p>

<p>From the user’s perspective, the three main steps of identity proofing and enrollment are 1) preparation, 2) identity proofing and enrollment, and 3) post-enrollment actions. These steps may occur in a single session, or there could be a significant amount of time between each one (e.g., days, weeks).</p>

<p>General and step-specific usability considerations are described in the subsections below and are described from the users’ perspective.</p>

<p>Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63a.html#ref-Section508">[Section508]</a> was enacted to eliminate barriers in information technology and require federal agencies to make electronic and information technology accessible to people with disabilities. While these guidelines do not directly assert requirements from Section 508, identity service providers are expected to comply with Section 508 provisions. Beyond compliance with Section 508, federal agencies and their service providers are generally expected to design services and systems with the experiences of people with disabilities in mind to ensure that accessibility is prioritized throughout identity system life cycles.</p>

</h3>

<p>The following usability considerations are applicable across all steps of the enrollment process. Additional information about these principles can be found in <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63a.html#usability-pre">Sec. 8.1.2</a>, <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63a.html#usability-proofing">Sec. 8.1.3</a>, and <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63a.html#usability-post">Sec. 8.1.4</a>.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>To avoid user frustration, streamline the identity proofing and enrollment process and make each step as clear and easy as possible.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Clearly communicate how and where to acquire technical assistance. For example, provide helpful information, such as links to an online self-service portal, chat sessions, and a phone number for help desk support. Ideally, sufficient information should be provided to enable users to answer their own enrollment preparation questions without outside intervention.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Clearly explain what personal data is being collected and whether collecting the data is optional or not. Additionally, provide information indicating with whom the data will be shared, where it will be stored, and how it will be protected.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Ensure that all information presented is usable.
    <ul>
      <li>Follow good information design practices for all user-facing materials (e.g., data collection notices, fillable forms).</li>
      <li>Write materials in plain language, and avoid technical jargon. If appropriate, tailor the language to the literacy level of the intended population. Use an active voice and a conversational style; logically sequence main points; use the same word consistently rather than synonyms to avoid confusion; and use bullets, numbers, and formatting where appropriate to aid readability.</li>
      <li>Consider text legibility, such as font style, size, color, and contrast with the surrounding background. The highest contrast is black on white. Text legibility is important because users have different levels of visual acuity. Illegible text will contribute to user comprehension errors or user entry errors (e.g., when completing fillable forms). Use sans serif font styles for electronic materials and serif fonts for paper materials. When possible, avoid fonts that do not clearly distinguish between easily confusable characters (e.g., the letter “O” and the number “0”). This is especially important for confirmation codes. Use a minimum font size of 12 points, as long as the text fits the display.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Perform a usability evaluation for each step with representative users. Establish realistic goals and tasks and appropriate contexts of use for the usability evaluation.</li>

<p>Ensuring that users are as prepared as possible for the identity proofing and enrollment process is critical to the overall success and usability of identity proofing and enrollment.</p>

<p>Such preparation is only possible if users receive the necessary information (e.g., the required documentation) in a usable format and in a timely manner. This includes making users aware of exactly what identity evidence will be required. Users do not need to know anything about IALs or whether the identity evidence required is considered FAIR, STRONG, or SUPERIOR.</p>

<p>To ensure that users are equipped to make informed decisions about whether to proceed with the identity proofing and enrollment process and what will be needed for their session, provide users with:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Information about the entire process, such as what to expect at each step
    <ul>
      <li>Clear explanations of the expected time frames to allow users to plan accordingly</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An explanation of the need for and benefits of identity proofing to enable users to understand the value proposition</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Identity evidence requirements for the intended IAL and a list of acceptable evidence documents with information about how they will be validated</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Information about whether there is a fee and, if so, the amount and variety of acceptable forms of payment</p>
  </li>
  <li>Relevant information on whether the identity proofing and enrollment process will be conducted on-site, over remote channels, or a combination of the two and whether the user has the option to choose
    <ul>
      <li>Information on the location, whether a user can choose their preferred location, and necessary logistical information for on-site attended or unattended sessions. Users may be reluctant to bring identity evidence to certain public places (e.g., a supermarket versus a bank), as it increases exposure to loss or theft.</li>
      <li>Information on the technical requirements (e.g., requirements for internet access) for remote sessions</li>
      <li>An option to set an appointment for remote attended or on-site attended identity proofing sessions in order to minimize wait times. If walk-ins are allowed, make it clear to users that their wait times may be greater without an appointment.
        <ul>
          <li>Provide clear instructions for how to schedule an identity proofing appointment, obtain reminders, and reschedule existing appointments, if necessary.</li>
          <li>Offer appointment reminders, and allow users to specify their preferred appointment reminder method (e.g., postal mail, voicemail, email, text message). Users need information such as the date, time, location, and a description of the required identity evidence.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Information on the allowed and required identity evidence and attributes, whether each piece is voluntary or mandatory, and the consequences for not providing the complete set of identity evidence. Users need to know the specific combinations of identity evidence, including requirements that are specific to a piece of identity evidence (e.g., a raised seal on a birth certificate). This is especially important due to potential difficulties procuring the necessary identity evidence.
    <ul>
      <li>Where possible, implement tools to make it easier to obtain the necessary identity evidence.</li>
      <li>Inform users of any special requirements for minors or people with unique needs. For example, provide users with information on whether applicant reference and/or trusted referee processes are available and the information necessary to use those processes (see <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63a.html#TRs-ARs">Sec. 3.14</a>).</li>
      <li>If forms are required:
        <ul>
          <li>Make fillable forms available before and during the identity proofing process.</li>
          <li>Do not require users to have access to a printer.</li>
          <li>Minimize the amount of information that users must enter on a form, as users are easily frustrated and more error-prone with longer forms. The CSP may auto-fill form fields when such data entry does not disclose personal information to unauthenticated users, such as data from scanned documents or data provided during the identity proofing process.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

</h3>

<p>The following usability considerations are specific to identity proofing and enrollment:</p>

<ul>
  <li>At the start of an identity proofing session, remind users of the procedure. Do not expect them to remember the process that was described during the preparation step. If the identity proofing session does not immediately follow the preparation step, it is especially important to clearly remind users of the typical time frame for completing the identity proofing and enrollment process.</li>
  <li>Depending on the identity proofing method (e.g., remote or on-site unattended), provide a separate video window with a step-by-step tutorial of the identity proofing process. When these types of tutorials or examples are offered, service providers should have a range of support options to cover a broad set of users. Alternatives to a video window include verbal or written instructions.</li>
  <li>Provide options for the user to reschedule the time or type of their identity proofing appointment, if needed.</li>
  <li>Provide a checklist with the allowed and required identity evidence to ensure that users have the requisite identity evidence to proceed with the identity proofing and enrollment process. If users do not have the complete set of identity evidence, they must be informed regarding whether they can complete a partial identity proofing session or use exception processing through a trusted referee or, as appropriate, applicant references for identity proofing exception processing. This would also apply to international users if the types of identity evidence and access to data, services, and validation sources may not be easily or readily available to achieve IAL identity proofing requirements. Trusted referees and applicant references are intended to provide capabilities for alternative identity proofing workflows and risk-based decisions for users who need exception processing.</li>
  <li>Notify users regarding what information will be destroyed or retained for future follow-up sessions and what identity evidence they will need to bring to complete a future session. Ideally, users can choose whether they would like to complete a partial identity proofing session.</li>
  <li>Set user expectations regarding the outcome of the identity proofing and enrollment process, including time frames for any subsequent activities (e.g., delivery of a notification of proofing).</li>
  <li>Clearly indicate whether users will 1) receive an authenticator immediately at the end of a successful identity proofing and enrollment process, 2) have to schedule a follow-up appointment to pick up an authenticator in person, or 3) receive the authenticator in the mail and, if so, when they can expect to receive it.</li>
  <li>
    <p>If subscriber-provided authenticators are permitted, provide information to users about how to register them to their subscriber accounts.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>During the identity proofing and enrollment process, there are several requirements to provide users with explicit notice, such as what data will be collected and processed by the CSP. See <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63a.html#ial-general">Sec. 3</a> and <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63a.html#privacy-section-header">Sec. 7</a> for detailed requirements on notices. CSPs should be aware that seeking consent from users for the use of their attributes for purposes other than identity proofing, authentication, authorization, or attribute assertions may make them uncomfortable. If users do not understand how they will benefit from the additional collection or uses, they may be unwilling or hesitant to provide consent or continue the process. Therefore, it is recommended that CSPs provide users with a thorough explanation of how they may benefit from the additional processing of their personal information and the steps that the CSP takes to mitigate the risks associated with such processing. Additionally, CSPs should provide users with the opportunity to opt out of the additional processing.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Confirmation codes are used to confirm that an applicant has access to a postal address, email address, or phone number for the purposes of future communications. If confirmation codes are used:
    <ul>
      <li>Notify users in advance that they will receive a confirmation code, when to expect it, the length of time for which the code is valid, and how it will arrive (e.g., physical mail, SMS, landline telephone).</li>
      <li>When a confirmation code is delivered to a user, remind the users which service they are enrolling in and include instructions on how to use the code and the length of time for which the code is valid. This is especially important given the short validity time frames specified in <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63a.html#ConfirmCodes">Sec. 3.8</a>.</li>
      <li>If issuing a machine-readable optical label, such as a QR Code (see <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63a.html#ConfirmCodes">Sec. 3.8</a>), provide users with information on how to obtain QR code scanning capabilities (e.g., acceptable QR code applications). Additionally, provide a human-readable code as an alternative to QR codes.</li>
      <li>Inform users what will happen if the confirmation code expires or is lost before use.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>If an applicant is unable to complete identity proofing and enrollment in a single session, or if they will have to complete identity proofing via a different identity proofing type (e.g., remote attended, on-site attended), they may be issued a continuation code.  Continuation codes are used to reestablish an applicant’s linkage to an incomplete identity proofing or enrollment process. If a continuation code is issued:
    <ul>
      <li>Provide users with information about continuation codes, why they are used, how they will be delivered, and how they will be used to complete their identity proofing process.</li>
      <li>When a continuation code is delivered to a user, remind them which service they are enrolling in and include instructions on what they need to do or where to go to complete the identity proofing or enrollment process.</li>
      <li>If issuing a machine-readable optical label, such as a QR Code (see <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63a.html#ContinueCodes">Sec. 3.9</a>), provide users with information on how to obtain QR code scanning capabilities (e.g., acceptable QR code applications). Additionally, provide a human-readable code as an alternative to QR codes.</li>
      <li>Provide users with alternative options for reestablishing their linkage to an incomplete identity proofing or enrollment process, as not all users may have access to the necessary technologies.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>At the end of the identity proofing and enrollment process:
    <ul>
      <li>If enrollment is successful, send subscribers a notification of proofing that confirms successful identity proofing and enrollment (see <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63a.html#ProofingNotifs">Sec. 3.10</a>) as well as directions on the next steps they need to take (e.g., when and where to pick up their authenticator, when it will arrive in the mail).</li>
      <li>If enrollment is partially complete (e.g., due to users not having the complete set of identity evidence, users choosing to stop the process, or session timeouts), communicate to users:
        <ul>
          <li>What information will be destroyed;</li>
          <li>What information will be retained for future follow-up sessions;</li>
          <li>How long the information will be retained; and</li>
          <li>What identity evidence they will need to bring to a future session.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>If enrollment is not successful, provide users with clear instructions for alternative identity proofing and enrollment options (e.g., on-site attended, use of trusted referee).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If users receive an authenticator during the enrollment session, provide instructions on its use and maintenance. For example, information could include instructions for use (especially if there are different requirements for first-time use or initialization), information on authenticator expiration, how to protect the authenticator, and what to do if the authenticator is lost or stolen.</p>
  </li>
  <li>For both in-person and remote identity proofing, additional usability considerations apply:
    <ul>
      <li>At the start of the enrollment session, operators or attendants need to explain their role to users (e.g., whether operators or attendants will walk users through the enrollment session or observe silently and only interact as needed).</li>
      <li>At the start of the enrollment session, inform users that they must not depart during the session and that their actions must be visible throughout the session.</li>
      <li>When biometric samples are collected during the enrollment session, provide users with clear instructions on how to complete the capture process. The instructions are best given just prior to the process. Verbal instructions with guidance from a live operator are the most effective (e.g., instructing users where the biometric capture device is and how to interact with it, when to begin the capture process, how to know when the biometric capture is completed).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Since remote identity proofing is conducted online, follow general web usability principles, such as:
    <ul>
      <li>Design the user interface to walk users through the enrollment process.</li>
      <li>Reduce users’ memory load through techniques such as simplifying the interface or using visual aids.</li>
      <li>Make the interface consistent.</li>
      <li>Clearly label sequential steps.</li>
      <li>Make the starting point clear.</li>
      <li>Support multiple platforms and device sizes.</li>
      <li>Make the navigation consistent, easy to find, and easy to follow.</li>
    </ul>

</h3>

<p>Post-enrollment refers to the step immediately following enrollment but prior to the first use of an authenticator. As previously described, users will have already been informed at the end of their enrollment session regarding the expected delivery, pick-up, or registration mechanism by which they will receive or add their authenticator.</p>

<p>Usability considerations for post-enrollment include the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Minimize the amount of time that users wait for their authenticator to arrive. Shorter wait times will allow users to access information systems and services more quickly.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Inform users whether they need to go to a physical location to pick up their authenticators. The previously identified usability considerations for appointments and reminders still apply.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Along with the authenticator, give users information that is relevant to the use and maintenance of the authenticator, such as instructions for use, especially if there are different requirements for first-time use or initialization; information on authenticator expiration; and what to do if the authenticator is lost or stolen.</p>
  </li>
  <li>

</h2>

<p>A primary aspect of customer experience is anticipating the needs of the user population and offering solutions that are suitable for that population. This becomes considerably more difficult within the context of identity proofing as the processes of identity resolution, validation, and verification each introduce their own user challenges. By analyzing the entire proofing process and assessing for common challenges, CSPs can deploy solutions that “meet the user where they are” and provide a more accessible and responsive set of solutions for their users. Consistent with the normative recommendations within this document, the following subsections discuss the value of deploying optionality and choice for users throughout the identity proofing process and the risks they can mitigate.</p>

<p>Whether deployed by a single CSP, multiple CSPs, or through an arrangement with RP customer service representatives, the use of multiple identity proofing types as defined in <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63a.html#ProofingTypes">Sec. 2.1.3</a> provides more opportunities for users to achieve positive proofing outcomes without sacrificing security or resorting to exception handling. When deployed with effective continuous improvement mechanisms, the use of multiple proofing types can support mitigation of the following common issues:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Users who are unable to complete automated or technology-heavy processes (e.g., due to limited technology fluency, physical or cognitive disabilities) or users for whom certain processes (e.g., automated biometric recognition) may be less effective</li>
  <li>Users who may rely on shared computing resources that may be prone to observation or other security risks</li>
  <li>Users who do not have reliable access to high-speed internet or computing devices that are capable of completing remote identity proofing processes</li>
  <li>Users who prefer human interactions to remote or automated processes</li>
  <li>Users who may have failed remote or automated approaches through no fault of their own (e.g., false rejections, failure to capture)</li>
</ul>

<p>Credible and authoritative sources provide a means to confirm the accuracy of identity data that an applicant claims during the proofing process. It is an essential step in preventing synthetic identity attacks and enabling accurate information for RPs to grant access and connect users to existing data and accounts. However, sources can also introduce inaccuracies, issues, and challenges, particularly when a single source is relied upon for a large volume of users. In such cases, issues with specific types of data can proliferate and persist across a larger user population. For example, the inability of a credible source to validate data from a single mobile network operator can impact entire regions or economic groups, even if data from other network operators is available and accurate.</p>

<p>Therefore, to support users more effectively, the integration of multiple data sources is important for CSPs. Such integrations need to be based on the core attributes that the CSPs and RPs require, the types of evidence available to users, and information about the effectiveness and population coverage of specific vendors based on testing and continuous evaluation processes. Additionally, the use of multiple vendors can create failover or waterfall processes that increase the likelihood of successfully completing identity proofing and limiting the need to expose users to exception handling processes. Leveraging multiple credible and authoritative sources minimizes risks to users who do not have a robust set of records or have incomplete records with individual sources.</p>

<p><a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63a.html#AttrValid">Section 2.4.2.3</a> and <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63a.html#ValidSources">Sec. 2.4.2.4</a> address the requirements for data validation and credible and authoritative sources.</p>

<p>Errors in the identity proofing process happen routinely and for a variety of reasons. Exception handling processes enable users to address issues associated with their identity proofing experience while still successfully establishing a subscriber account and accessing services. When deployed with effective continuous improvement mechanisms, exception handling processes can help mitigate the following common issues:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Users with limited history at credible or authoritative sources</li>
  <li>Users whose records with credible or authoritative sources may be incomplete, inaccurate, or impacted by errors resulting from past identity theft</li>
  <li>Users without common forms of identity evidence or whose evidence has been lost, destroyed, stolen, or otherwise compromised</li>
  <li>Users who are unable to complete automated or technology-heavy processes due to internet bandwidth limitations, limited access to devices capable of completing remote identity proofing processes, limited technological fluency, physical or cognitive disabilities, or for whom certain processes (e.g., automated biometric recognition) may be less effective</li>
  <li>Users whose attributes have changed and whose records do not reflect those changes</li>
  <li>Users whose records may be difficult to match as a result of name formatting and data entry design with the identity system</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63a.html#TRs-ARs">Section 3.14</a> provides specific requirements for exception handling processes. Since exception handling processes result in the acceptance of some risk, they can often be combined with other controls to limit RP exposure. These can include limiting authorizations, entitlements, and access or applying additional monitoring for subscriber accounts that are established under exception handling processes. For RPs to implement these controls, CSPs must provide RPs with an indicator that exception handling processes were used, either in the assertion, via an API, or using another real-time mechanism.</p>

<p><em>This section is informative.</em></p>

<p>A wide variety of terms are used in the realm of digital identity. While many definitions are consistent with earlier versions of SP 800-63, some have changed in this revision. Many of these terms lack a single, consistent definition, warranting careful attention to how the terms are defined here.</p>

<dl>
  <dt>applicant</dt>
  <dd>A <em>subject</em> undergoing the processes of <em>identity proofing</em> and <em>enrollment</em>.</dd>
  <dt>applicant reference</dt>
  <dd>A representative of the <em>applicant</em> who can vouch for the identity of the applicant, specific <em>attributes</em> related to the applicant, or conditions relative to the context of the individual (e.g., emergency status, homelessness).</dd>
  <dt>approved cryptography</dt>
  <dd>An encryption algorithm, <em>hash function</em>, random bit generator, or similar technique that is <em>Federal Information Processing Standards</em> (FIPS)-approved or NIST-recommended. Approved algorithms and techniques are either specified or adopted in a FIPS or NIST recommendation.</dd>
  <dt>assertion</dt>
  <dd>A statement from an <em>IdP</em> to an <em>RP</em> that contains information about an authentication event for a <em>subscriber</em>. Assertions can also contain identity <em>attributes</em> for the subscriber in the form of attribute values, derived attribute values, and attribute bundles.</dd>
  <dt>attribute</dt>
  <dd>A quality or characteristic ascribed to someone or something. An identity attribute is an attribute about the identity of a <em>subscriber</em> (e.g., name, date of birth, address).</dd>
  <dt>attribute validation</dt>
  <dd>The process or act of confirming that a set of <em>attributes</em> are accurate and associated with a real-life identity. See <em>validation</em>.</dd>
  <dt>authenticate</dt>
  <dd>See <em>authentication</em>.</dd>
  <dt>authenticated protected channel</dt>
  <dd>An encrypted communication channel that uses <em>approved cryptography</em> in which the connection initiator (client) has <em>authenticated</em> the recipient (server). Authenticated protected channels are encrypted to provide confidentiality and protection against active intermediaries and are frequently used in the user <em>authentication</em> process. <em>Transport Layer Security</em> (TLS) and Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63a.html#ref-RFC9325">[RFC9325]</a> are examples of authenticated protected channels in which the certificate presented by the recipient is verified by the initiator. Unless otherwise specified, authenticated protected channels do not require the server to authenticate the client. Authentication of the server is often accomplished through a certificate chain that leads to a trusted root rather than individually with each server.</dd>
  <dt>authentication</dt>
  <dd>The process by which a <em>claimant</em> proves possession and control of one or more <em>authenticators</em> bound to a <em>subscriber account</em> to demonstrate that they are the <em>subscriber</em> associated with that account.</dd>
  <dt>authentication assurance level (AAL)</dt>
  <dd>A category that describes the strength of the <em>authentication</em> process.</dd>
  <dt>authenticator</dt>
  <dd>Something that the <em>subscriber</em> possesses and controls (e.g., a <em>cryptographic module</em> or <em>password</em>) and that is used to <em>authenticate</em> a <em>claimant’s</em> identity. See <em>authenticator type</em> and <em>multi-factor authenticator</em>.</dd>
  <dt>authenticity</dt>
  <dd>The property that data originated from its purported source.</dd>
  <dt>authoritative source</dt>
  <dd>An entity that has access to or verified copies of accurate information from an <em>issuing source</em> such that a <em>CSP</em> has high confidence that the source can confirm the validity of the identity attributes or evidence supplied by an <em>applicant</em> during <em>identity proofing</em>.

Often, authoritative sources are determined by a policy decision of the agency or CSP before they can be used in the identity proofing <em>validation</em> phase.</dd>
  <dt>authorize</dt>
  <dd>A decision to grant access, typically automated by evaluating a <em>subject</em>’s <em>attributes</em>.</dd>
  <dt>biometric reference</dt>
  <dd>One or more stored <em>biometric samples</em>, templates, or models attributed to an individual and used as the object of biometric comparison in a database, such as a facial image stored digitally on a passport, fingerprint minutiae template on a National ID card, or Gaussian Mixture Model for speaker recognition.</dd>
  <dt>biometric sample</dt>
  <dd>An analog or digital representation of biometric characteristics prior to biometric feature extraction, such as a record that contains a fingerprint image.</dd>
  <dt>biometrics</dt>
  <dd>Automated recognition of individuals based on their biological or behavioral characteristics. Biological characteristics include but are not limited to fingerprints, palm prints, facial features, iris and retina patterns, voice prints, and vein patterns. Behavioral characteristics include keystroke cadence, the angle of holding a smartphone, screen pressure, typing speed, mouse or mobile phone movements, and gyroscope position, among others.</dd>

  <dt>credential service provider (CSP)</dt>
  <dd>A trusted entity whose functions include <em>identity proofing</em> <em>applicants</em> to the identity service and registering <em>authenticators</em> to <em>subscriber accounts</em>. A CSP may be an independent third party.</dd>
  <dt>credible source</dt>
  <dd>An entity that can provide or validate the accuracy of <em>identity evidence</em> and <em>attribute</em> information. A credible source has access to attribute information that was validated through an <em>identity proofing</em> process or that can be traced to an <em>authoritative source</em>, or it maintains identity attribute information obtained from multiple sources that is checked for data correlation for accuracy, consistency, and currency.</dd>
  <dt>digital identity</dt>
  <dd>An <em>attribute</em> or set of attributes that uniquely describes a <em>subject</em> within a given context.</dd>
  <dt>digital signature</dt>
  <dd>An <em>asymmetric key</em> operation in which the <em>private key</em> is used to digitally sign data, and the <em>public key</em> is used to verify the signature.
